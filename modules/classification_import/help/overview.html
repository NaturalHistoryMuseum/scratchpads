<p>Importing a classification is currently a <strong>one-way</strong> process.  This means that it is not
currently possible to import a classification, export it for editing, and then
re-import it.</p><p>Users may upload as many classifications as they like,
including non-biological classifications (such as geographic regions, food
groups, etc).</p>
