<h3>ITIS Parent/Child</h3>
<p>The ITIS Parent/Child format is based on the
<a href="http://www.itis.gov/submit.html" target="_blank">submission
guidelines</a> for ITIS.  We have tweaked the format slightly to suit the
Scratchpads and the specific requirements of our users.</p><p>The difficult
step in producing a file of this type, is ensuring that the parent name for each
taxon name is <strong>EXACTLY</strong> the same as another name listed in the
file - this includes the authority information of the name.</p>
