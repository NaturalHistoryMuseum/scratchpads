<p>This format is very similar to the <a href="&topic:csv_import/parentchild&">Parent/Child</a>
import format.  The main difference though, is that each term lists ALL of the
ancestors associated with it, and there is therefore no need for a specific
"parent_name" column.</p><p>As with the <a href="&topic:csv_import/parentchild&">Parent/Child</a>
format, this format also supports many additional fields based upon the column
header name.</p><p>An <a href="path:fullhierarchy.xls">example file for this format</a> should help 
you to get started, and looks something like:</p><p><img src="path:fullhierarchy.png"/></p>
