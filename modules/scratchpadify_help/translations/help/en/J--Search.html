    <p>There are several ways to find specific content on a Scratchpad. One way is to use the Search box in the left sidebar, which has three different search options: simple, taxonomy, and advanced. Check out the <a title="Search" href="&amp;topic:scratchpadify_help/search&amp;" target="_blank">help page for the search box</a>.</p>
<p>Further options to find content on a Scratchpad are through the Content menu as explained in the 'Basic features' chapter, through <a title="List content" href="/admin/content/node" target="_blank">'List' Content/Data</a> in the basic administration page, through the 'Track' option under '<a title="My account" href="&amp;topic:scratchpadify_help/my-account&amp;" target="_blank">My Account</a>' in the Navigation menu, and through '<a title="Recent posts" href="/tracker" target="_blank">Recent posts</a>' in the Navigation menu. When using the first two options, the content is or can be sorted by content type. When using the last two options the content is sorted by date of last editing. Content that is not published is best found via 'List' Content/Data.</p>
