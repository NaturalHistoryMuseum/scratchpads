    <p>Specimen data in a Scratchpad conform to the Darwin Core (version 1.2.1) format recommended by TDWG (Biodiversity Information Standards) and GBIF. They are separated into two content types: locality and specimen, which allows you to connect different specimens to the same locality.</p>
<p>The title of a specimen node is a combination of the 'Institution code', 'Collection code', and 'Catalogue number text' fields which together should form a unique title. If you don’t know the codes or if there isn’t a ‘catalogue number text’ you have to make them up.</p>
<p>You are confronted by five diffe­rent tabs: Re­quired, Taxonomy, Collection, Miscellaneous, and Location. Each of these tabs has different fields that can optionally be completed in order to create a new specimen  record.</p>
