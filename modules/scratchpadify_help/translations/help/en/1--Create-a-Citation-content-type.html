    <ul>
<li>Go to the advanced administration page. In the 'Content Management' section click on 'Content types' and then on the 'Add content type' tab. </li>
<li>In the 'Identification' section enter the name (Citation), type (citation) and description (Keywords and page number linking taxa with references) of the new content type. </li>
<li>In the 'Vocabularies' section select the classification you want to be associated with the citations. </li>
<li>In the 'Autotag settings' section you can choose whether content of this type should be automatically tagged or not. </li>
</ul>
<p>The default is on autotagging, which means that if data are imported they will be automatically tagged with this term occuring in the fields. </p>
<ul>
<li>In the 'Submission form' section enter the title field label (Taxon name as cited). You do not need a body field, so delete the word "body" in 'Body field label'. </li>
<li>If you are working with organic groups and want to be able to use this content type within a group you need to change selection in the 'Organic groups' section to "Standard group post" or one of the other choices. </li>
<li>Click on 'Save content type'. </li>
<li>In the list of content types scroll down to your new content type and click on 'manage fields'. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you wanted your fields to be sorted into groups, you would have to enter text in the two fields for 'New group' and save. Groups are useful if you have many fields. In a detailed description all head characters could for example belong to the group "Head". After adding groups first you can start adding fields, but you can also add the groups at a later stage and drag and drop the fields into the groups. However, for the Citation content type we don't need groups.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the 'Add' section and 'New field'. Enter the label (Page) and field name (page) and select the field type "Text" and form element "Text field". Click on 'Save'.<br />
Enter the help text (First page number where taxon is cited). Adding a 'Help text' is useful if you want to advise users on a certain format, for example for type information, or just to explain what kind of information belongs into this field.<br />
Under 'Text processing' you can choose 'Plain text' if you don't need any special formats like italics. However, if you choose plain text and the users accidentally copies formatted text into this field, the html codes for these formats will show up in the field after saving. So if you expect a lot of copy/paste to happen, 'Filtered text' is the better option. </li>
<li>Click on 'Save field settings'. </li>
<li>Add another 'New field' with the label (Bibliography) and field name (biblio) and select the field type "Node reference" and form element "Autocomplete text field". Save.<br />
For this field we chose "Node reference" instead of "Text" because we don't want to enter a bibliographic citation, but instead link to an existing biblio node.</li>
<li>In the 'Global settings' section choose the content type 'Biblio' and under 'Advanced' choose "biblio-nodes" as 'View used to select the nodes'. Save. </li>
<li>Now you can either add another text field called Keywords, or you make a new taxonomy called Citation Keywords, for which you select only the content type ‘Citation’ and only the settings ‘Tags’ and ‘Multiple select’ (open a new browser tab to add the new taxonomy to keep the current page open and close the tab when you are done). If you do the latter, you don't need to add another field to the citation content type because you will be able to choose keywords when adding a citation automatically. </li>
<li>Under 'Manage fields' you can sort the fields by drag and drop. </li>
<li>Under the 'Display fields' tab, you can choose where the label should go. Choosing 'inline' will save space and allow for more fields to be visible on the screen without scrolling. Save. </li>
<li>As soon as a new content type is saved it is added to the ‘Content’ menu. Click on the “Add a Citation node” icon and enter two or three test citations (tagged to 'Carnus hemapterus').</li>
</ul>
<p>
The ‘Citation’ content type is now finished and a widget was automatically added to the taxon pages. However, it is hidden and you need to go a taxon page which actually has a citation tagged to it (Carnus hemapterus), and drag the new widget into the active section (see 'Taxon pages' chapter). We are now going to improve the view of the widget and afterwards we will make a new page to enable a better search for citations. For learning purposes we will create a completely new view, though we could modify the one which has been automatically generated.</p>
