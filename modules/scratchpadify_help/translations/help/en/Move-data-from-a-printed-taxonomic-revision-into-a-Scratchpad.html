    <h4>Format of revision</h4>
<ul>
<li>Assuming you have a Word document with the final manuscript, you would copy text from this document into the Scratchpad rather than copying from a pdf. </li>
<li>If the text in your document is consistantly structured, like a checklist for example or species descriptions, it can also be an option to transfer these structured data into a tab delimited file by replacing certain key characters (e.g. the paragraph sign) with the tab character and then cleaning up the resulting matrix in Excel. There are also special programs, like Golden Gate, that parse data.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Structure of revision on Scratchpad</h4>
<ul>
<li>Generally speaking the taxonomy of the revised group should be part of the taxonomic classification on the Scratchpad in order to generate taxon pages with the descriptions, images, specimens and biblio. The general information of the paper goes into pages which can be linked via a menu. You can check out the revision of the genus <em>Milichiella</em> at <a title="Milichiella online revision" href="http://milichiidae.info/content/milichiella-online-revision">http://milichiidae.info/content/milichiella-online-revision</a> and a smaller online-only paper at <a title="Milichiidae of the Lake Kerkini region in Greece" href="http://milichiidae.info/content/milichiidae-lake-kerkini-region-greece">http://milichiidae.info/content/milichiidae-lake-kerkini-region-greece</a>. These are just examples, obviously you can do it differently if you want.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps to take</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Taxonomy</strong>: If you don't have a taxonomic classification on your Scratchpad, create a <a title="How do I add and import an ITIS standard taxonomy?" href="http://scratchpads.eu/how-do-i-add-and-import-itis-standard-taxonomy">new ITIS name vocabulary</a>. Either create a file in the correct format and import the nomenclatural data or add the data to the Editor by copy and pasting them from your manuscript. You should add valid/accepted names as well as synonyms, basionyms/original combinations or subsequent combinations to the classification and optimally link them to the bibliography after you imported the literature.</li>
<li><strong>Literature</strong>: <a title="How do I import a library of bibliographic references?" href="http://scratchpads.eu/how-do-i-import-library-bibliographic-references">Import the literature</a> into the Scratchpad or <a title="How do I create a bibliographic citation?" href="http://scratchpads.eu/how-do-i-create-bibliographic-citation">add the citations</a> by hand. This should include the citation of your revision. The biblio of your revision should have the pdf attached if possible, or include a link to the pdf. It should also be tagged with all the taxa covered.</li>
<li><strong>Specimens</strong>: <a title="How do I import content?" href="http://scratchpads.eu/how-do-i-import-content">Import </a>the localities and specimens (see <a title="Manual for advanced training course" href="/scratchpad-training-files">Manual for advanced training course</a>) or <a title="How do I create a location?" href="http://scratchpads.eu/how-do-i-create-location">add localities</a> and <a title="How do I create a specimen record?" href="http://scratchpads.eu/how-do-i-create-specimen-record">specimens </a>by hand.</li>
<li><strong>Images</strong>: <a title="How do I add an image or collection of images?" href="http://scratchpads.eu/how-do-i-add-image-or-collection-images">Add the images</a> and tag them with the classification, the biblio of your revision and if possible also the specimens. If you have plates, you can tag them to all the species shown on this plate. However, if there are figures of several species on a plate it is better to separate the figures because otherwise figures will show up on the wrong species pages.</li>
<li><strong>Taxon descriptions</strong>: The best content type for descriptions is the <a title="How do I add a taxon description?" href="http://scratchpads.eu/how-do-i-add-taxon-description">Taxon description</a> content type because you can later show these descriptions in EOL if you want. However, the fields are quite general and you might want to have a more anatomised description. If this is the case you have to <a title="How do I create a custom content type?" href="http://scratchpads.eu/how-do-i-create-custom-content-type">create a custom content type</a> with the fields you need.</li>
<li><strong>Phylogenetic trees</strong>: <a title="How do I create a phylogenetic tree?" href="http://scratchpads.eu/how-do-i-add-phylogenetic-tree-0">Add phylogenetic trees</a> and link them to the classification.</li>
<li><strong>General information</strong>: General chapters like 'Materials &amp; Methods' or 'Introduction' should be <a title="How do I create a page?" href="http://scratchpads.eu/how-do-i-create-page">added as pages </a>and linked via a <a title="How do I manage and create menus and blocks?" href="http://scratchpads.eu/how-do-i-manage-and-create-menus-and-blocks">menu </a>for this revision.</li>
<li><strong>Morphological information</strong>: General morphological information that is not part of the taxon descriptions can either be <a title="How do I create a page?" href="../../how-do-i-create-page">added as pages</a> or as a <a title="How do I create a glossary?" href="http://scratchpads.eu/how-do-i-create-glossary">glossary</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Acronyms</strong>: Museum acronyms can also be add as a <a title="How do I create a glossary?" href="../../how-do-i-create-glossary">glossary</a>, however, you can only have one glossary. So if you have a morphological glossary, you can add a list of acronyms as a page.<a title="How do I create a glossary?" href="../../how-do-i-create-glossary"><br /></a></li>
<li><strong>Keys</strong>: The best option would be to generate an <a title="How to I show a Lucid key on my Scratchpad?" href="http://scratchpads.eu/how-i-show-lucid-key-my-scratchpad">interactive key</a> and show it on the Scratchpad. Dichotomous keys can be <a title="How do I create a page?" href="../../how-do-i-create-page">added as pages </a>with the terminal taxa linked to the respective taxon pages. Dichotomous keys are highly formatted, so it is a bit of work to recreate this format on the Scratchpad. If you want to avoid this, you could create a pdf of the key and attach the file to the description of the higher taxon, e.g. the genus if the key is to the species of this genus.</li>
