    <p>A single web site could contain many types of content, such as informational pages, news items, polls, blog posts, specimen data, etc. In Drupal, each item of content is called a <em>node</em>, and each node belongs to a single <em>content type</em>, which defines the fields and various default settings for nodes of that type, such as whether the node is published automatically and whether comments are permitted.</p>
