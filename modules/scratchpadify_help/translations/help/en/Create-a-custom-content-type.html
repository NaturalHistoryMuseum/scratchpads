Creating a content type allows you to create content in which the data are entered and saved in specific fields. If you already have data available, which are stored in a table or a database, you can create a custom content type with exactly the same fields and import the data into the Scratchpad. To show the data to the user in the best possible way you can then improve the view for this content type which is automatically generated.

<ul>
<li>Go to the advanced administration page by going to the URL "<a title="Advanced administration page" href="/admin" target="_blank">.../admin</a>" or clicking on 'Administer' and then 'Advanced' in the navigation menu under your user name. Go to 'Content Management' &gt; 'Content types' and click on '<a title="Add content type" href="/admin/content/types/add" target="_blank">Add content type</a>'.</li>
<li>In the 'Identification' section enter the name, type and description of the new content type.</li>
<li>In the 'Vocabularies' section select the classification you want to be associated with the citations. </li>
<li>In the 'Autotag settings' section you can choose whether content of this type should be automatically tagged or not.</li>
<li>In the 'Submission form' section enter the title field label. If your content type is going to be a species description the title field could for example be "species name". Usually you will not need a body field, so delete the word "body" in 'Body field label'.</li>
<li>Choose your prefered settings under 'Workflow' and 'Image Attach settings'.</li>
<li>If your new content type deals with geographic locations, for example if you want to prepare distribution maps, you also need to choose settings under 'Locative information'. Choosing "1" as the both the maximum and the default number of locations will result in each node having one location. Choose the other settings according to your needs.</li>
<li>Click on 'Save content type'.</li>
<li>In the list of content types scroll down to your new content type and click on 'manage fields'.</li>
<li>If you want your fields to be sorted into groups, click enter text in the two fields for 'New group' and save. Groups are useful if you have many fields. In a detailed description all head characters could for example belong to the group "Head".</li>
<li>After adding the groups you can start adding fields. Actually, you can also add the groups at a later stage and drag and drop the fields into the groups.</li>
<li>Go to 'Add' &gt; 'New field'. Enter the label and field names and choose the field type and form element. This will usually be a text field, but you have many other options to choose from. Click on 'Save'.</li>
<li>Enter the help text and choose the other settings. Adding a 'Help text' is useful if you want to advise users on a certain format, for example for type information, or just to explain what kind of information belongs into this field.</li>
<li>Under 'Text processing' you can choose 'Plain text' if you don't need any special formats like italics. However, if you choose plain text and the users accidentally copies formated text into this field, the html codes for these formats will show up in the field after saving. So if you expect a lot of copy/paste to happen, 'Filtered text' is the better option.</li>
<li>Click on 'Save field settings'.</li>
<li>Under 'Manage fields' you can&nbsp;sort the groups and fields by drag and drop.
	</li>
<li>Under 'Display fields' you can choose where the label should go. Choosing 'inline' will save space and allow for more fields to be visible on the screen without scrolling. Click on 'Submit' to save changes.</li>
