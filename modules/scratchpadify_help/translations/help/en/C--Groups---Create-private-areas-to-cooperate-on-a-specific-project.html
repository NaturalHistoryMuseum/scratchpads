    <p>Let's assume you want to prepare data for your 'PaperX' online, but you don't want anybody to see these data, yet, except for yourself and maybe some co-authors. However, you plan to make all the data visible to everyone as soon as the paper is published. The best way to do this is by using an organic group.<br />
Organic groups are private areas on a Scratchpad which are only accessible to group members. A user can have a higher user role within a group. For example someone who is contributor to the main Scratchpad can be editor for a group and therefore edit group content created by other group members. Content generated within a group can be publicly visible or hidden and the whole group can be hidden as well.<br />
The creator of a group is usually responsible for managing the group and its users, but he/she can also give this responsibility to another user.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hover with the mouse over ‘Group’ in the ‘Content’ menu and click on the 'Add a group node' icon which appears to the right. </li>
<li>Enter the Group Name and Description. The Group Name should be short as it will show up in the web addresses of all content you produce within this group. </li>
<li>We don't mind people knowing about this group, so 'List in groups directory', can be checked. However, we don't want anybody except coauthors in the group, so we don't want the group to appear in the registration form, and keep the 'Registration form' field unchecked. If you select this field, you will get an email informing you of applications and asking you to approve or disapprove a new member. Choose the membership request you prefer. For our example select 'Invite only'. Save the group. </li>
<li>You are now on the group's main page. Click on the 'Edit' tab to further configure your group. </li>
<li>Under the 'Disallow public posts in this group' select 'Do not allow public posts in this group'. This will ensure that you can't make any content created in this group public, that is visible to non-group members. </li>
<li>Click on 'Next' and 'Save'. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your group is now establish under the alias: …/content/groupname and all content you create within this group will have the alias …/groupname/contenttitle. It is useful to activate the Group detail block (through the administration pages), because it for example enables you to add content to the group from all group pages and to add new members to your group by clicking on ‘1 member’ (or 2, 3, ... members) in the group block. Check out this option. You can also add members to your group by clicking on 'Group' in the Content menu and clicking on the name of the group in the table. In the Content menu underneath the 'Group' link will now be two additional links to "Members" and "My membership". Click on "Members" and then on the 'Add members' tab to add users.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now add a few examples of content to your group. When you are on the main group page every content you add using the content menu will automatically be added to the group. Otherwise you can add content to a group by selecting the group under the 'Access' tab in the 'Advanced options' section. </li>
<li>Log out of the Scratchpad to verify that the content you added to this group is not showing. You might have to reload the page for this. </li>
</ul>
<p>We are now assuming that your paper was published and that you want all the data in your group to be visible to everyone. </p>
<ul>
<li>Log back in and you will see the group content again. Go back to your group for example via the 'Group' link in the Content menu and clicking on the 'My groups' tab. Edit the group and click on the 'Delete' button. You will be asked what you want to do with the group's posts. Select 'Do nothing' and click on the 'Delete group' button. Your group is now deleted and all the content which belonged to this group is publicly available on your site.</li>
</ul>
