    <p>To create an image gallery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the '<a title="Add image" href="/node/add/image">Add a Image node</a>' icon in the 'Content' menu and then click on 'Add a new image Gallery' under the Image gallery drop down box.
</li>
<li>Give the gallery a name and description. Under the 'Advanced options' you can choose a parent image gallery or “weight” the gallery to determine its position relative to other image galleries – the default gallery is simply called “Library”. When complete, click 'Save'.
	</li>
<li>When you click on the image gallery page <a title="Image galleries" href="/image">…/image</a> you will see a thumbnail of the last image uploaded as an example for this gallery. If you want to fix a specific image in this place you need to edit this image and select 'Sticky at top of lists' under the 'Publishing options'.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Click on 'Taxonomy' in the Content menu</li>
<li>Click on 'list terms' for the 'Image galleries' taxonomy.</li>
<li>Click on 'edit' for the term you want to delete or edit.</li>
<li>Either click on the 'Delete' button or edit the term and click the 'Save' button.</li>
</ul>
