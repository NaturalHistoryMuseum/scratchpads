Many Scratchpads have a classification/taxonomy menu enabled. Clicking on a term in the classification opens the respective taxon page. Clicking on the plus icon opens the child taxa of this term. You can also click on ‘Taxonomy’ above the search field, wait for the circle to appear in the right corner, enter a term and click on the 'Go' button.
