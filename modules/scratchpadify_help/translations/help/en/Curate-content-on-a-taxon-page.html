<p>You can curate the content shown in a panel/widget on a taxon page. This means that you can change the order of the content shown or select which content should be shown and which should not.</p>
<p> <img src="/sites/scratchpads.eu/files/u3/PanelSort2.jpg" alt="Panel sorting screenshot" title="Panel sorting screenshot" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; border: 1px solid black;" width="341" height="167" />To curate a panel/widget click on 'sort' in the upper right corner of the panel. A window with three colored areas opens. In the yellow area you can set the number of nodes/content to display. This will set the number for this panel on all taxon pages, not just the one you are viewing currently, so be very careful in selecting lower numbers than the one shown, because it will restrict the nodes shown on other taxon pages even if you had previously set a higher number for those pages. As soon as you start moving nodes the number will automatically adjust to the number of nodes in the green area without affecting other taxon pages.</p>
<p>In the green area you will see the nodes which will be shown in the panel. However, if no node is shown in the green area all nodes in the red area will be shown. In the red area are the nodes which will not be shown in the panel, except if there are no nodes in the green area.</p>
<p> To move nodes from the red to the green area, you hover with the mouse over the respective node and click on the green "tick" icon. Clicking on the red "cross" icon will permantely remove a node from the green and red area. Click 'Close' or press the Escape button on your keyboard to save. Actually there is no way to not save your changes, so be careful with the delete button. Renew your webpage to view the changes.</p>
<p>As a default a selection of 50 nodes is shown in the red area. Even if there are actually more nodes tagged with this term, you don't have the option to recruit them for the panel selection (deleting the ones present doesn't help). The only way to move Scratchpad nodes into the selection is by clicking 'Sticky at top of lists' under the 'Publishing options' tag under the 'Advanced options' of each node.</p>
