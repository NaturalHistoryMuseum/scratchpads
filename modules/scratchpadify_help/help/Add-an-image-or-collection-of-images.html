There are two ways to add an image. You can either add images directly into a page or you can upload an image separately from a page using the ‘Image’ content type. For collections of images (e.g. to create an image gallery) we recommend that you use the ‘image’ content type because this gives you more flexibility and control over the display, annotations and reuse of these images.

<ul>
<li>Add an image to a page using the <a title="Rich text editor" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/rich-text-editor&" target="_blank">rich text editor</a>:
<ul>
<li>In the rich text editor, click on the tree icon.</li>
<li>In the 'Insert/edit image' window click on the icon next to the ‘Image URL’ field.</li>
<li>A new window opens which shows your file directory. Click on 'Upload' at the top and browse for and then upload your image. The image file will appear in the list of files and will be marked in blue, showing that it is the active file. Now click on 'Send to tinymce' (tinymce is the rich text editor) and you will be back to the Insert/edit image window.</li>
<li>Enter a description, choose the alignment and ‘insert’. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Upload images: Hover over ‘Image’ in the 'Content' menu and click on the plus icon which appears to the right of the menu item. You now have two options. If you want to <a title="Upload single image" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/upload-single-image&" target="_blank">upload only one image</a> fill in the fields on this page, browse for and upload the image and save. If you want to upload several images, click on '<a title="Add multiple images" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/add-multiple-images&" target="_blank">multiple upload page</a>'.</li>
</ul>
<p>Uploaded images are added to the 'Library' image gallery by default when using the multiple image upload. You can add more image galleries if you wish so (see <a title="Create, edit or delete an image gallery" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/create-edit-or-delete-image-gallery&" target="_blank">Create, edit or delete an image gallery</a>).</p>
