    <p>Location and specimen data can be imported using a comma or tab separated file created within an Excel spreadsheet. You will need to import first the file with the location data and then the file with the specimen data. The files need to contain at least the required fields. To check which fields are required add a location/specimen and find the fields marked with a red asterisk. In addition to these fields you should add a 'Taxonomic name' for specimens. You may also choose to add additional data as you see fit. It will make the import easier if you use the correct field names in the header. Subsequent rows should contain the records. Make sure that for the fields which appear as drop down menus when you add a location/specimen, you enter one of these options in your matrix because the import will not work with terms that are not in this list. The same holds for the 'Taxonomic name': you need to enter a term that is in your vocabulary.</p>

<li>We have prepared some example locations and specimens for this course, which can be downloaded from <a title="Training files" href="http://scratchpads.eu/scratchpad-training-files" target="_blank">http://scratchpads.eu/scratchpad-training-files</a> (Carnidae_locality.txt, Carnidae_specimen.txt).</li>
<li>Click the 'Import from CSV file' icon under locality in the 'Content' menu. </li>
<li>Upload your file and click 'Next'. </li>
<li>Follow the instructions that appear on screen, uploading the file, choosing 'Tab separated' values, matching the column headings and parsing the data into the Scratchpad database. </li>
<li>Next import the specimen file into the specimen content type. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very quick way to bulk import records.
