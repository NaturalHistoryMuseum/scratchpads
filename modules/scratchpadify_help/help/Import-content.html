    <p>Content can be imported into each <a title="Content types" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/content-types&" target="_blank">content type</a> (e.g. page, locality, specimen) of a Scratchpad. Generally, all imported data need to be in a spreadsheet format, with a column for each field and a row for each record. A header row with the correct field names as they appear in the content type into which you want to import data, facilitates the import. The spreadsheet needs to be saved as a comma- or tab-delimited file. Exceptions are bibliographic citations, which are imported in special bibliographic formats, and images, which are uploaded as image files, e.g. jpg.</p>
<p>When you have your tab- or comma-delimited files ready, go to the respective content type in the content menu and click on the import icon which appears to the right of the menu item when you hover over it with the mouse. </p>
<ul>
<li>Click on 'Upload file', browse for the file and upload.</li>
<li>Click on 'Next', choose the correct file format and 'Reload page' if necessary, click on 'Next'</li>
<li>Map the fields of your file to the fields in the content type, click on 'next', click on 'next'. </li>
<li>Check the settings and click on 'next'. </li>
<li>Check the preview and if there are any errors go back to your original file, change it and start from the beginning. It is often useful to preview more than just the default 5 records. If the preview is o.k., click on 'next' and then start the import. If there are errors during the import it is best to download the respective rows, edit the downloaded table and reimport. </li>
<li>Click on the respective content type in the content menu to view the imported data. </li>
</ul>

Tips: If you save an Excel spreadsheet as tab-delimited file quotationsmarks are automatically added around all fields that contain commas and will be imported. To delete them open the file in Notepad or Word, remove all quotationsmarks and save. Alternatively, save Excel spreadsheets as comma-delimited (csv) files.
</p>
<p>
To avoid problems with diacritics or other special characters the imported file should be in UTF-8 format. File format can for example be changed by opening the file in MS Word and saving it as plain text, which opens a dialog box in which you can select 'other encoding' and choose 'Unicode (UTF-8)'.
