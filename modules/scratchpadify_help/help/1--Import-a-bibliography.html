<li>Firstly, we will import a bibliography that has been exported from Endnote (Exporting from Endnote X is as simple as selecting 'Export' from the 'File' menu, and saving the Library in XML format). </li>
<li>Download the "<a title="Training files" href="http://scratchpads.eu/scratchpad-training-files" target="_blank">Carnus.xml</a>" file, which is in Endnote 8+ XML format. </li>
<li>Click the 'Import a Bibliography from your reference manager' icon appearing next to 'Biblio' in the 'Content' menu. This will bring up a form with a number of options. Browse for the XML file you just downloaded; select Endnote 8 XML from the pull down menu; then click 'Import'. Wait while the records are imported. </li>
<li>Click 'Biblio' in the Content menu and you should see all your imported records. During the import all biblio records are automatically tagged with the classification terms which appear in the title or keywords of the record. Switch to the <em>Carnus hemapterus</em> species page, refresh it and scroll down to the Bibliography panel to see the biblios tagged with this term. Switch back to the Biblio page.</li>
