<li>Firstly, we will import a bibliography that has been exported from Endnote (Exporting from Endnote X is as simple as selecting 'Export' from the 'File' menu, and saving the Library in XML format). </li>
<li>Download the "<a title="Training files" href="http://scratchpads.eu/scratchpad-training-files" >Biblio_Import.xml</a>" file, which is in Endnote 8+ XML format. </li>
<li>Bibliographic references can be automatically tagged with taxon names<br />
held within a Scratchpad classification. This works through the title<br />
and keywords fields. Autotagging needs to be enabled by going to the<br />
advanced administration page and clicking on 'Autotag settings' in the<br />
'Site configuration' section. Under 'Default for "Autotag on save"',<br />
select "Biblio" and save the configuration.</li>
<li>Click the 'Import a Bibliography from your reference manager' icon appearing next to 'Biblio' in the 'Content' menu. This will bring up a form with a number of options. Browse for the XML file you just downloaded; select Endnote 8 XML from the pull down menu; then click 'Import'. Wait while the records are imported. </li>
<li>Click 'Biblio' in the Content menu and you should see all your imported records. Switch to the <em>Carnus hemapterus</em> species page, refresh it and scroll down to the Bibliography panel to see the biblios tagged with this term. Switch back to the Biblio page.</li>
