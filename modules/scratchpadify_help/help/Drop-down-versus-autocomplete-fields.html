    <p>When tagging a node to a classification you can either have a drop down menu or an autocomplete field. This is dependent on your <a title="Batax settings" href="/admin/settings/batax" >Batax settings</a>, which can be accessed via the advanced administration page. The default Batax term number is 10. This means that if a classification has ten or less terms a drop down menu will be used and if it has more than ten terms, an autocomplete field is used. You can change this number if needed.</p>
