    <p>The focus of this course lies on the import of data and the creation of custom content types and views.</p>
<p>For an online training course, keep the training window open next to a window with the training site.</p>
<p>The instructions are written for use with special <strong>training sites</strong>. The training sites are provided for the courses we teach, but are also available on request. You can also do the course on your own on the <a title="Scratchpad sandbox" href="http://sandbox.scratchpads.eu/" >Sandbox</a> (username: test, password: pass). If you use the sandbox you must be prepared that other users may change the site at the same time and you must be aware that the sandbox is rebuild every 6 hours. So best start just after it was rebuild. What you see on the sandbox will differ from the training sites only in the 'Log in' section at the start of the course.</p>
<p>Training sites are established at: <a href="http://trainingXX.taxon.name" title="http://trainingXX.taxon.name">http://trainingXX.taxon.name</a></p>
<p>Replace the 'XX' with the number that you have been issued. Log in with the following credentials:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Username:username</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Password: password<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Training files</strong> can be downloaded from <a title="Trainingfiles" href="http://scratchpads.eu/scratchpad-training-files" >http://scratchpads.eu/scratchpad-training-files</a>. Keep this page open in a separate tab in your browser and download files as needed. </p>
<p>Browser: For the course please use the <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong> browser which can be downloaded from <a title="Mozilla Firefox" href="http://www.mozilla.com/" >http://www.mozilla.com</a>. If you don't have administrative rights on your computer you can use <a title="Portable Firefox" href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable" >Portable Firefox</a>. </p>
<p>The aim of this course will be to create a taxonomic website for the fly family Carnidae, specifically a species page for the bird parasite <em>Carnus hemapterus</em>. You can see what your training site might look like at the end of the basic and advanced course at <a title="Example Carnidae training site" href="http://carnidae.myspecies.info" >http://carnidae.myspecies.info</a>.</p>
<p>For this course we need a classification and a bibliography on our training site. Both have been covered in the basic training course. Please go to the following chapters to import a classification and bibliography:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="2.1. Add a vocabulary" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/2-1--Add-a-vocabulary&" target="_self">2.1 Add a vocabulary</a></li>
<li><a title="2.2. Import from EOL" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/2-2--Import-from-eol&" target="_self">2.2 Import from EOL</a></li>
<li><a title="4.1. Import a bibliography" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/4-1--Import-a-bibliography&" target="_self">4.1 Import a bibliography</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now start working through the advanced course.</p>
