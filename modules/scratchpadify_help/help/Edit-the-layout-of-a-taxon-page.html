Click on a term in your classification menu to open the respective taxon page. Click on the lock icon in the upper right corner to edit the layout of the taxon page. Click on the header bar of a taxon page view (panel) to drag and drop this view to another place. If you drag a view below the 'Content below this block will be hidden' block, it will be hidden from view for all users. The same can be achieved by clicking on the red cross which appears in the upper right corner of a view when the mouse hovers over this view.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When you are finished editing the layout you need to click again on the lock icon and select whether you want to use this layout for all unset taxon pages or only for this taxon page. Unset taxon pages are the ones which do not have a layout that was specifically saved for this page.
</p>
<p>
When you view a (locked) taxon page, you can see arrows in the upper right corner of each panel/widget. These can be used to change the width or height of the respective panel. The moment you press the width or height buttons, the new layout is saved, i.e. there is no need to hit the padlock and save the layout.<br />The change will apply to just that page if it has previously had its layout saved, or if there is no saved default layout for that vocabulary.  If there is a saved default, and that page hasn't had a different layout saved, then the change will apply to all pages of that vocabulary. <span></span>
</p>
<p>
Tip: A taxon page view (panel) is only shown if content is present for this taxon. So if you save your layout and a certain panel is missing this might be the reason.
