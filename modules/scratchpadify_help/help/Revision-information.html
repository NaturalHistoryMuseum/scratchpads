    <p>Revisions let you track differences between multiple versions of a node. When you edit an existing node but want to preserve the earlier version, check 'Create new revision'. You can also add a log message with an explanation of the changes you did. When you have created a revision, a 'Revision' tab will appear for this node next to the 'Edit' tab. Clicking on this, logged in users will be able to view older versions of this node and you yourself will be able to revert the node to an older version.</p>
