Each user is assigned one or more roles. By default there are two roles: <em>anonymous</em> (a user who has not logged in) and <em>authenticated</em> (a user who has signed up and been authorized). Without signing up, users are extremely limited in the types of content they can create. Signed up users also benefit by allowing them to associate content they create with their account and by allowing various permissions to be set for their role within the site.
</p>
<p>
Users can fine tune some personal configuration settings through their individual <em>my account</em> page. Registered users need to authenticate by supplying either a local username and password or a remote username and password, such as an OpenID.
</p>
<p>
<em>Authenticated users</em> can be given the additional roles of <em>contributor</em>, <em>editor</em> or <em>maintainer</em> by any maintainers of the site. The person who applied for the site automatically has the maintainer role.
</p>
<p>
Permissions for user roles (roles are additive, so an <em>authenticated user</em> has the roles cited in addition to the ones cited for the <em>anonymous user</em>, a <em>contributor</em> has the roles cited in addition to the ones cited for the <em>authenticated user</em>, etc.):
