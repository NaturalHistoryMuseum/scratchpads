    <p>The front page is the main entry page to your website. This page is shown when users go to the URL of your website (...myspecies.info) or click on the logo. At the top of the front page the <a title="Mission statement" href="../../&amp;topic:scratchpadify_help/mission-statement&amp;">mission statement</a> is shown. It disappears when a user is logged in. The default for the front page is a 'news' page. A 'news' front page shows teasers of all the nodes (posts) which have been promoted to the front page. When you add or edit a node you have the option under ‘Show advanced options' &gt; ‘<a href="&amp;topic:scratchpadify_help/publishing-options&amp;">Publishing options</a>' to select ‘Promoted to front page'. Usually the last promoted node will will be the first in the list. However, if you also select ‘Sticky at top of lists', the node will stay at the top of the list.</p>
<p>If you don't want a 'news' page, you can fix a static page as your front page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to ‘Administer’ &gt; 'Advanced' &gt; ‘Site configuration &gt; ‘<a title="Site information" href="/admin/settings/site-information">Site information</a>’.</li>
<li>Enter the URL of the page you want to use as front page under ‘Default front page’.</li>
</ul>
