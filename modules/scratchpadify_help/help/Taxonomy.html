    <p>The taxonomy module contains controlled vocabularies. These do not have to be biological classifications. Country lists, keywords etc. can all be treated as "taxonomies" in the context of your site. Vocabularies are the backbone of a Scratchpad and link together the content. They are used to generate taxon pages.</p>
