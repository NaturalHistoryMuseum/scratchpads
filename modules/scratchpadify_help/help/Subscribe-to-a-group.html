Subscription to a group depends on whether you already have an account for the site.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	If you already have an account, log in, go to a page in the group you are interested in. Click on ‘request subscription’ in the group block in the left or right sidebar. Add ‘Additional details’ to help the group manager decide on your subscription (the manager needs to eliminate spam subscriptions). You can also subscribe to a group by clicking on ‘Groups’ in your personal menu (the one under your user name) and clicking on ‘subscribe’ next to the chosen group.
	</li>
<li>
	If you don’t have an account go to ‘User login’ in the left or right sidebar, click on ‘Create new account’, enter the requested data and under ‘Groups’ check the box next to the group you want to subscribe to.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
For groups where approval is needed, the manager will receive an email with your request and will then decide on your subscription. Depending on the settings of the site you will receive a confirmation email or not.
