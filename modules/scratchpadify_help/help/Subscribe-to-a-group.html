Subscription to a group depends on whether you already have an account for the site.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	If you already have an account, log in, click on '<a title="Group" href="/og" target="_blank">Group</a>' in the Content menu and click on the 'Join' or 'Request membership' link for the group you are interested in. On the next screen add details if this option is present and click on the 'Join' button.&nbsp;
	</li>
<li>
	If you don’t have an account go to ‘User login’ in the left or right sidebar, click on ‘Create new account’, enter the requested data and under ‘Groups’ check the box next to the group you want to subscribe to.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
For groups where approval is needed, the manager will receive an email with your request and will then decide on your subscription. Depending on the settings of the site you will receive a confirmation email or not.
