    <ul>
<li>Click on the 'Add a Specimen (D.w.C. 1.2.1) node' icon in the 'Content' menu. Once the page loads you will be confronted by five different tabs: Required, Taxonomy, Collection, Miscellaneous, and Location. Each of these tabs has different fields that can optionally be completed in order to create a new specimen record. </li>
<li>Start creating a fictitious specimen, by filling out the fields under the Required tab.</li>
<li>The 'Taxonomy' tab contains the basic information about the identification of your specimen. The important field here is the second one, 'Taxonomic name', which is linked directly to all your site's vocabularies. </li>
<li>Fill in some more information under the 'Collection' and 'Miscellaneous' tabs, this can be as little or as much as you like.</li>
<li>Finally, under the 'Location' tab, select the location you created earlier. Now press the 'Save' button. </li>
<li>You should now be taken to a page where you can view your specimen. </li>
<li>Click on 'Clone' to create a similar specimen from the same location by just changing the 'Catalog number text'.</li>
</ul>
<p>This specimen can now be linked to from an image. In practice most people will (at least initially) want to enter locality and specimen records in bulk. This can be done by importing a comma or tab separated file created within an Excel spreadsheet. Importing is explained in the ' <a title="Training files" href="http://scratchpads.eu/scratchpad-training-files" >Manual for advanced training course</a>'.</p>
