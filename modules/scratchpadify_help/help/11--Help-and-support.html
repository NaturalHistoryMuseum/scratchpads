    <p>Help and tips for working with Scratchpads can be found in a series of help pages available through clicking on the questionmark icons. Screencasts are available at <a title="Scratchpad screencasts" href="http://scratchpads.eu/screencasts" >http://scratchpads.eu/screencasts</a>. The screencasts have not yet been updated to the current Drupal 6 version of the Scratchpads and will deviate from what you can actually see and do in some cases.</p>
<p>For feature requests and bug reports please use the Issues button which appears on the right hand side when you are logged in. If you have specific questions or would like advice or help in how to best set up your site, please email the Scratchpad team at <a href="mailto:%20scratchpad@nhm.ac.uk">scratchpad@nhm.ac.uk</a>. Don't be afraid to ask 'stupid' questions and don't get hung up on a problem for hours. In some cases the solution might be easy (you just have to know itâ€¦) in others it might be a bug only our programmer can solve.</p>
<p>To get ideas you can also check what other people have done with their sites and how they have customized them: Browse the list of the current Scratchpads at <a title="Scratchpad sites" href="http://scratchpads.eu/sites" >http://Scratchpads.eu/sites</a>. To find examples for certain features check out <a title="Scratchpad examples" href="http://scratchpads.eu/live-examples-scratchpad-features" >http://scratchpads.eu/live-examples-scratchpad-features</a>.</p>
