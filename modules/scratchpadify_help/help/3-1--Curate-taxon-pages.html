<li>We want to improve the layout of the taxon pages. Click the "padlock" icon at the top right corner of the page. Try dragging the widgets around to get the best arrangement, e.g. move the panels for the content you will contribute (bibliography, image, specimens, specimens map) to the top of the page. Also try closing some of the unused widgets (with no content) by clicking the red cross associated with those widgets.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>When you have the arrangement you like, click the padlock icon again. You can choose to apply this arrangement to all taxon pages, or only to the page you just made.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When you first set up your site there will be a lot of widgets showing which you don't need. Close all unnecessary widgets as they will only distract from the content you want to present.</p>
