<div id="node-10" class="node">



  
  <div class="content clear-block">
    <p>Create a menu item linking to this node by entering a title and choosing a parent menu item. The menu blocks are denoted by "&lt; &gt;". The default option is &lt;Secondary links&gt;, which is usually (depending on your theme) a second line of menu items in the header, below the &lt;Primary links&gt;. If you want a new menu block in the sidebar, you have to create it first (go to <a title="Add menu" href="/admin/build/menu/add" target="_blank">Add menu</a>). </p>
<p>Don't add menu items to the &lt;Navigation&gt; block, because it will mess up this block and the links will only be visible to logged in users. Usually the items in a menu block are sorted alphabetically. If you want to have a different order you can sort the items by giving them different 'Weights'.</p>
