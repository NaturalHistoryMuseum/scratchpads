    <p>The focus of the basic course lies on adding various kinds of data and generating taxon pages. Our goal is to provide a taste of what the sites can do, and allow you to independently explore the Scratchpad after the event.</p>
<p>
You can skip parts of the course you already know about, however, be aware that some parts build on each other. For example to do the taxon based chapters you need to import a classification first.</p>
<p>For the basic training course you can prepare by downloading the '<a title="Trainingfiles" href="http://scratchpads.eu/sites/scratchpads.eu/files/Carnus_files.zip" >Training_Files.zip</a>' file to your computer and extracting the files. </p>
