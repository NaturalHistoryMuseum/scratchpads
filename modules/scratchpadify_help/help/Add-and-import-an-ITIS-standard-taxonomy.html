    <p>The taxonomy module and taxonomic editor are a work in progress, so as we are developing there might be changes to this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on 'Taxonomy' in the 'Content' menu and click on ‘Add vocabulary’ at the top.</li>
<li>Enter a ‘Vocabulary name’ and ‘Description’.</li>
<li>
	Unselect the ‘Content types’ which should not be tagged with this classification. When creating content users will be able to tag content of the selected content types to the new classification. Remember that every time you add a new content type you will have to go back to this page to enable this new content type to be tagged.
	</li>
<li>Extend the 'Settings' section. If you have content which relates to several terms in your classification/taxonomy, select ‘Multiple select’. Under 'Content type' select 'ITIS name' in the drop down menu. Later you will also be able to select the 'Classification type, which will customize the drop down menus to show only terms used in botanical, zoological or protozoan classifications, respectively. However, this doesn't work, yet (2. June 2010).
	</li>
<li>Save.</li>
<li>Click on the ‘Import’ tab and select the vocabulary you just created. </li>
<li>Click on ‘CSV file' (your file can also be in tab or Excel format), browse for your classification file, select the 'ITIS Parent/Child' file type, and click on the 'Import from CSV file' button.</li>
<li>Wait for the classification to fully import. You should see a bar showing progress and counting the number of terms imported. When the classification was successfully imported a tinytax block with your classification will appear in the left sidebar. You may have to renew your browser window to see it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 'ITIS Parent/Child' file has to follow the standards used by the <a title="ITIS standards" href="http://www.itis.gov/submit.html" >Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS)</a>. Check our training materials for an <a title="ITIS standard example file" href="/sites/scratchpads.eu/files/ITIS_Name_Example.txt" >example file</a>. The file can have the following fields (fields marked with '*' are required): </p>
<ul>
<li>unit_ind1: <span style="color: black;">Indicator of an occurrence of a plant hybrid at the generic level. The only value allowed is "X".<br /></span></li>
<li>unit_name1*: <span style="color: black;">The singular or first part of a scientifically accepted label for an occurrence of Taxonomic Units. </span>For  uninomials (1-part names like family or genus names) this will be the only name field entered. For binomials/polynomials, this field will be used for the first part of the name (the genus name). The names in this position require the initial letter to be capitalized.</li>
<li>unit_ind2: <span style="color: black;">A category indicator positioned between the first and second parts of a binomial/polynomial taxonomic name. </span><span style="color: black;">The only value allowed is "X".</span></li>
<li>unit_name2: <span style="color: black;">The second part of a scientifically accepted label for a binomial/polynomial occurrence of Taxonomic Units (the species epithet).</span></li>
<li>unit_ind3: <span style="color: black;">A category indicator located within a polynomial taxonomic name. Allowed values are: "ssp." (plants and fungi), "subsp." (animals and monerans),</span> "var.", "subvar.", "f.", "subf.",<span> and "X".<span> </span><br /></span></li>
<li>unit_name3: <span style="color: black;">The third portion of a scientifically accepted label for a polynomial occurrence of Taxonomic Units (e.g. subspecies name).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: black;">unit_ind4: Same as unit_ind3.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: black;">unit_name4: Same as unit_name4.<br /></span></li>
<li>taxon_author: <span style="color: black;">The author(s) associated with the name of a taxon. This can include the year of publication and brackets, e.g. "(Quoy and Gaimard, 1832)<span>".</span></span> </li>
<li>rank_name: <span style="color: black;">The label associated with the specific level of a taxonomic hierarchy, e.g. "Family", "Genus" or "Species". For values check <a title="ITIS standards" href="http://www.itis.gov/submit.html" >ITIS </a>or the taxonomic editor for an existing classification on your site. <strong>Note that the spelling and capitalisation of the ranks in your import file must match the ranks in the Scratchpad!</strong></span> </li>
<li>usage*: <span style="color: black;">Current standing of an occurrence of Taxonomic Units. Allowed values are: "accepted" (plants and fungi),</span> "not accepted" (plants and fungi), "valid" (animals and monerans)<span>, and "invalid" (animals and monerans)<span>.</span></span> </li>
<li>parent_name*: An ITIS term denoting the taxon that is the next highest level from the subject valid or accepted taxon. <span>&nbsp;</span>The parent of a species is usually a genus; the parent of a genus is usually a family, and so on. This parent-child linkage between records is the basis for the classification hierarchy in ITIS.
<ul>
<li>Import rules: All valid/accepted names must have one and only one "parent". <strong>The format for the "parent" entry in a given record is to include the full name AND author (if applicable) of the parent in one field</strong>. </li>
<li>Examples: "Species=Homo sapiens; enter parent=Homo Linnaeus, 1758", "Genus=Arum; enter parent=Araceae (this family does not have an author in ITIS)<span>"</span></li>
<li><span>Synonyms: For the Scratchpad import synonyms also need to have a parent, which will determine its place in the hierarchy. Usually a synonym is shown as child term of the accepted name, so parent and accepted name are the same. It is also possible to add a synonym as sister taxon to the valid name, however, during import the taxa on one rank level are sorted alphabetical, so in the classification tree it will not be possible to see which is the valid name for a synonym.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>accepted_name: The scientific name, including author, of the valid or accepted taxon identified as the currently accepted name used for a given invalid or not accepted name. Each name that is in synonymy (junior synonyms, obsolete combinations, etc.) must be connected to one accepted or valid name.&nbsp;<span></span>
<ul>
<li><span>Import rules: In contrast to the "parent" links (see above), only the scientific name not the author values must be entered in this field. This is different from the ITIS standard.<span>&nbsp;</span><br /></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>unacceptability_reason:&nbsp;An explanation regarding why a given scientific name is judged to be invalid or not accepted. Unacceptability reasons vary among&nbsp; kingdoms.<span> </span><span style="color: black;">For values check <a title="ITIS standards" href="http://www.itis.gov/submit.html" >ITIS </a>or the taxonomic editor for an existing classification on your site. </span><strong><span style="color: black;">Note that the spelling and capitalisation of the reasons in your import file must match those in the Scratchpad!</span></strong> </li>
<li>page_number<span>: The page number the taxon was described on in the protologue. This field is not part of the ITIS standard.</span></li>
<li><span>vernacular_name: Enter vernacular names for this taxon, comma-separated.</span><span> This field is not part of the ITIS standard.</span></li>
<li><span>'custom fields': You can import more fields, like for example 'type information', but you must add these fields to the 'ITIS Name' content type before you import.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p>For more information see the <a title="ITIS standards" href="http://www.itis.gov/submit.html" >ITIS website</a>. </p>
<p>To edit your classification and associated data click on 'Taxonomy' in the 'Content' menu and then on 'Editor' next to the classification you want to edit. Extend the classification by clicking on the 'plus' icons. Click on the taxon you want to edit. This will open a box on the right side, in which you can edit the various fields. Don't forget to save before you move to another taxon. You can also search for a taxon by clicking on the binocular icon, entering the name and then starting the search by clicking on the binocular. You can move taxa on the tree via drag and drop. The taxonomic editor is a work in progress and we are for example working on showing invalid/not accepted terms in a different colour.</p>
<p>
Tip: If you want to add a batch of new taxa to your classification, you can just import the file with the new taxa into your existing vocabulary as described above. The root taxon of the imported classification will appear below the existing classification. Go to the 'Editor' to drag and drop the new taxa to the correct place. Delete duplicate taxa but be careful not to delete taxa from the old classification because if any data on your Scratchpad have been tagged to these terms, you will lose the tagging information. This is because the each term is a node with a node number and content is linked to the node and not the term word.</p>
<p>When you have finished moving all taxa to the correct place, refresh the browser window. The classification block should now show the correct classification.</p>
