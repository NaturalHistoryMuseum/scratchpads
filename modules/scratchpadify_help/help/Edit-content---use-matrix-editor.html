It might be confusing to know what to do when you work with the views (panels) on the taxon pages. You have to first click on the title of the item in the panel to go to the respective page and only then you can edit it.
</p>
<p>
To edit pages other users created you need to have the role of editor or you can ask the respective creator to give you access to this page.

<h3>Matrix editor</h3>
<p>You also have the option to edit the content of several nodes of the same content type at once using the matrix editor. </p>
<ul>
<li>To open the matrix editor go to the Content menu and hover with the mouse over the content type you want to edit, e.g. 'Image'. Click on the 'Edit image nodes in a grid layout' icon to open the matrix editor. You will see a matrix with a row for each node - in this case each image - and columns for selected fields of this content type. The rows are ordered chronologically, with the most recent images at the top.</li>
<li>To edit content select one or more fields within a column (Ctrl+click on PC, Apple+click on Mac) and edit the content in the field that appears below the matrix. Then click on the ‘Save changes’ button.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>To adapt the selection of fields or filter for certain content click on 'Advanced filters' above the matrix.</li>
<li>Under 'Title' you can type part of the title, e.g. if you are looking for images with "Carnus" in the title, just type "Car" and click on the 'Apply' button. To remove the filter keep the 'Title' field empty and click on 'Appy' again.</li>
<li>Under 'Author' you can filter for content added by one or more certain users.</li>
<li>Under 'Fields to display' you get a list of all the fields available for this content type and can select those fields that you want to edit (multiple select by Ctrl+click on PC, Apple+click on Mac). Click on the 'Update fields' button to save the selection.</li>
</ul>
