	You can assign roles two ways: 1. Mark the users you want to assign the same role to, select this role from under "Add a role to the selected users" from the drop down menu under ‘Update options’, and click on ‘Update’. 2. Click on ‘edit’ to the right of the user you want to change. Under ‘Role’ choose the roles you want to assign to this user. Click on ‘Save’.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Tip for Scratchpads with groups: You have to be aware that a user will have the role you assign to him this way for the whole site including all groups he/she is subscribed to. You can not downgrade a user within a group. Therefore the best way in most cases is to give a user a low role for the whole site and upgrade his/her role within certain groups.
