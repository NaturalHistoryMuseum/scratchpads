    <p>In a node list context (such as the front page or term pages, e.g. image galleries), list items (e.g. "teasers") will be ordered by "stickiness" (see Publishing options) then by "node weight" then by the "authored on" datestamp. Items with a lower (lighter) node weight value will appear above those with a higher (heavier) value.</p>
