    <p>A block is a box of content that may be rendered into certain regions of your web pages, for example, into sidebars. Frequently a block contains a <a title="Menus" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/menus&" target="_blank">menu</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to ‘Administer’ &gt; 'Layout’ &gt; ‘<a title="Blocks administration page" href="/admin/build/block" target="_blank">Blocks</a>’.
	</li>
<li>
	If you want to add a block click on ‘<a title="Add block administration page" href="/admin/build/block/add" target="_blank">Add block</a>’, fill in the requested information and save the block.
	</li>
<li>
	To make the new or an existing disabled block active you have to give it a place on the page by clicking on &lt;none&gt; under ‘Regions’ and choosing one of the places. The block will move to the place you indicated. You can also drag &amp; drop the block at the correct position.
	</li>
<li>
	Click on ‘Save blocks’. Click on ‘configure’ to change block specific settings.
	</li>
<li>
	If you want the block to appear only within a certain group go to ‘Page specific visibility settings’, check ‘Show on only the listed pages’ and enter the pages. For one group you have to enter “content/groupname” as well as “groupname/*” in the next line to cover all the pages within this group.
