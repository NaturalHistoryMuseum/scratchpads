<li>Adapt <a title="Change user profiles" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/Change-user-profiles&" target="_self">user profiles</a>.

<li>Add a <a title="Taxonomy" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/Taxonomy&" target="_self">classification</a>.</li>
<li>Create content. To link the different content together it is best to add the <a title="Biblio" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/Biblio&" target="_self">bibliography </a>first, then <a title="Location" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/Location&" target="_self">locations</a>, <a title="Specimen" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/Specimen&" target="_self">specimens </a>and <a title="Image" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/Image&" target="_self">images</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Tips:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about what kind of information you want to present on your Scratchpad. If you want a taxonomic site you will probably need to import a taxonomic classification and tag the nodes to this classification. If the site is more focussed on a social aspect you might prefer to have free tagging.</li>
<li>Think about how you want to present the information on your site. If you want to give some users access to some content and other users access to different content, you should establish <a title="Groups" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/Groups&" target="_self">groups </a>before you create the content, so that you can link the content to a group immediately. </li>
<li>If you want to add many images you should first <a title="Create, edit or delete an image gallery" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/Create---edit-or-delete-an-image-gallery&" target="_self">create image galleries</a> to properly sort your images.</li>
</ul>
