    <p>Autotagging means that when you save or import content, this content is automatically tagged with all the terms of the associated vocabularies that are present in the title or one of the other fields. If for example the title includes a binominal species name, the node is automatically tagged with this species name as well as the genus name, since the genus name is part of the species name.</p>
