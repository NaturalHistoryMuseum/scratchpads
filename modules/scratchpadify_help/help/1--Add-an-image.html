<li>Click 'Add Image node' in the Content menu. You are presented with an option to upload single or multiple images. Try the single image option first.</li>
<li>Enter a title (e.g. "Carnus hemapterus, male") and enter "Carnus hemapterus" in the Carnidae classification box. Select the 'Library' image gallery.</li>
<li>Complete the appropriate fields relevant to your image and browse for the "<a title="Training files" href="http://scratchpads.eu/scratchpad-training-files" target="_blank">Car_hem_M_lateral.jpg</a>" image. <em>You can upload another image into the same node, which will result in both images being shown on the same page. However, usually it will be better to upload each image as a separate node. </em>Click 'Save'.</li>
<li>Click on the image link in the Content menu. You will see your image in the 'Library' gallery. Try clicking into the gallery, clicking on the image title, and editing the annotations associated with the image. <em>When you click on an image title in a gallery, the image node opens. When you click on the image itself, a sort of slide show opens in which you can move from one image to the next.</em></li>
