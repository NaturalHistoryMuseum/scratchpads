    <p>You can set up your Scratchpad in another language than English and translations are provided for a number of languages. However, depending on the language only a certain amount of the necessary terms will be translated and you will have to provide the missing translations yourself. To enable a language you need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to 'Administer' &gt; 'Advanced', and click on '<a title="Language" href="/admin/settings/language" target="_blank">Languages</a>' in the 'Site configuration' section.</li>
<li>Click on the '<a title="Add language" href="/admin/settings/language/add" target="_blank">add language</a>' tab and select the language you need from the drop down menu. Click the 'Add language' button and the translations will be imported.</li>
<li>Choose which language should be the default by clicking on the 'Default' radio button and save the configuration.</li>
<li>Under the 'configure' tab you have the option to select 'Path prefix with language fallback'. If you select this, the user's display language will be determined by the setting of his browser. So if your Scratchpad has English and Spanish enabled and your user's browser setting is for Spanish, he will see the Spanish version of your site.</li>
<li>Under the 'list' tab there is a link to '<a title="Translate interface" href="/admin/build/translate/search" target="_blank">translate interface page</a>'. Click on this link if you want to provide missing translations. For example 'Countries map' in the Content menu is a term provided by us and there will not be a translation. Enter 'Countries map' in the 'String contains' field and click on the search button. You will get a list of phrases which contain your search term. Or if there are no translation you get only one record with the language crossed out. Click on 'edit', enter the translation and save. You should now see the translation of 'Countries map' in the Content menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>The imported translations as well as those provided by you are only for the interface, that is instructions, field names and the preset menu names for example, but not for content. If you want to provide content in several languages, you have to set up the respective content types for multiple languages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to 'Administer' &gt; 'Advanced', and click on '<a title="Content types" href="/admin/content/types" target="_blank">Content types</a>' in the 'Content management' section. Find the content type for which you want to enable multiple languages and click on 'edit'. Under the 'Workflow settings' section and 'Multilingual support' select 'Enabled, with translation' and save the content type.</li>
<li>Now add a new node to this content type. You will see that you now have the option to choose the language via a dropdown menu. Select one language, fill in the other fields in this language and save. When you view this page you will now see an additional 'translate' tab. Click on this tab and you will see a list of the languages you have enabled on your site. Click on 'add translation', enter data in the respective language and save. Below the node you will have a link to the other translation of this page.</li>
</ul>
