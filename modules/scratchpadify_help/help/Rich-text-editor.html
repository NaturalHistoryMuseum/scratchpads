    <p>When you enter text in a body field you have three options. You can either enter the text as ‘plain text’, ‘html code’ or you can enable the rich text editor. If the body field shows as a white square the rich text editor is disabled. You can enable it by clicking on ‘enable rich text’ below the text box. In the rich text editor you can enter and format your text similar to using MS Word. You can enable the rich text editor by default in your personal settings (see How to personalize my account). Hovering the mouse over an icon will show the icon’s explanation.
</p>
<p>If the page doesn’t turn out the way you want to, check the html code by toggling (reclicking) the ‘enable/disable rich text link’ beneath the text box or using the 'HTML' icon. This often happens if you import text from other websites or cut and paste text from MS Word. Often fixing the text display just involves removing the line breaks (paragraph marks). Another way to avoid a screwed up format is to use the 'Paste from Word' icon or 'Paste as plain text' icon. However, 'Paste from Word' adds additional line breaks which have to be removed by checking the html code, and 'Paste as plain text' removes all formats including italics AND removes some spaces thereby joining some words. These bugs will hopefully be fixed sometime, in the meantime it is probably best only to use 'Paste from Word' because it is easier remove line breaks than finding missing spaces.</p>
<p>You can set an anchor anywhere on the page using the anchor icon. To link to this anchor you need to insert a link using the chain icon. Enter "#[anchor name]" as the link URL if the anchor is on the same page or the path (e.g. /content/new-page#[anchor-name]) if the anchor is on a different page from the same site or http://scratchpad/content/new-page#[anchor-name] from a different site).</p>
