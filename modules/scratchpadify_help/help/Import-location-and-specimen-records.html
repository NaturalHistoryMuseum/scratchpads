    <p>Location and specimen data can be imported using a comma or tab separated file created within an Excel spreadsheet. You will need to import first the file with the location data and then the file with the specimen data. The files need to contain at least the <strong>required fields</strong>. To check which fields are required add a location/specimen and find the fields marked with a red asterisk. In addition to these fields you should add a 'Taxonomic name' for specimens. You may also choose to add additional data as you see fit. It will make the import easier if you use the correct field names in the header. Subsequent rows should contain the records. Make sure that for the fields which appear as drop down menus when you add a location/specimen, you enter one of these options (in the exact same spelling and capitalisation) in your matrix because the import will not work with <strong>terms </strong>that are not in this list. The same holds for the 'Taxonomic name': you need to enter a term that is in your vocabulary.</p>

We have prepared some example files, which can be downloaded from <a title="Training files" href="http://scratchpads.eu/scratchpad-training-files" >http://scratchpads.eu/scratchpad-training-files</a><br /> (Location_Import.txt, Specimen_Import.txt).</p>
<ul>
<li>To import your location file, click the 'Import from CSV file' icon which appears when you hover with the mouse over 'Location' in the 'Content' menu. </li>
<li>Upload your file and click 'Next'. </li>
<li>Follow the instructions that appear on screen, uploading the file, choosing 'Tab separated' values, matching the column headings and parsing the data into the Scratchpad database. </li>
<li>Next import the specimen file into the specimen content type. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very quick way to bulk import records.
</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The 'Earliest/latest <strong>date </strong>collected' fields should be in the format "2007-06-20", but formats like "6/20/2007" also work. The system can't handle unknown data, so if you know the month a specimen was collected, but not the date for example, then you enter it like 'earliest date collected'= "6/1/2007", 'latest date collected'="6/30/2007". If you only know the year, you give the range from 1. Jan. to 31. Dec. for that year. We have devided the identification date into three fields, because in most cases only the year is given. If there is a month, then it needs to be imported as "February", for example.</p>
<p>
<strong>Tips</strong>: If you save an Excel spreadsheet as tab-delimited file <strong>quotationsmarks </strong>are automatically added around all fields that contain commas and will be imported. To delete them open the file in Notepad or Word, remove all quotationsmarks and save. Alternatively, save Excel spreadsheets as comma-delimited (csv) files.
</p>
<p>
To avoid problems with <strong>diacritics </strong>or other special characters the imported file should be in UTF-8 format. The file format can for example be changed by opening the file in MS Word and saving it as 'Plain text (*.txt)', which opens a dialog box in which you can select 'other encoding' and choose 'Unicode (UTF-8)'. Another option is to use the program EditPad Lite, which is freely available online. Go to 'Convert', check 'Encode the original data with another character set...', select 'Unicode, UTF-8, check the Preview and click on 'OK'.
</p>
<p>Another problem that can occur when saving an Excel csv file is that depending on the country/region your computer is set for, Excel will use not a comma as separator but instead a different character, like a semicolon. To change this go to the control panel of your computer, open the Regional and Language Options dialog box, click the Regional Options Tab and click Customize. Type a comma in the List separator box and click OK twice.
