Views are the way in which data in custom content types are presented to the user. You can for example choose to present your data in a list, a table, or on a map and you can add filters to help the user find specific data.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to 'Administer' &gt; '<a title="Views" href="/admin/build/views" >Views</a>' and click on '<a title="Add view" href="/admin/build/views/add" >Add</a>'.</li>
<li>Enter a name and description for the view.</li>
<li>The view type will usually be 'Node' for custom content types.</li>
<li>Click on 'Next'.</li>
<li>Under 'Filters' click on the plus icon to add a new filter. In the box that opens below choose 'Node' in the drop down menu under 'Groups'. Scroll down, check 'Node: Type' and click on 'Add'. Select the correct node type and click on 'Update'. Click on 'Save'. </li>
<li>Under 'Fields' click on the plus icon to add a field. In the box that opens below choose 'Node' in the drop down menu under<br />
	'Groups'. Scroll down, check 'Node: Title' and click on 'Add'. Update the title if necessary and check 'Link this field to its node'. 'Update'. Add more fields as necessary. Custom fields can be found under 'Groups' &gt; 'Content'. You can expose a filter, which will produce a search box for the user. </li>
<li>Save. If you want to check your new view click on 'View "Page"' in the upper right corner. You can go back to editing the view by clicking on the light grey '[Edit]' link which appears below the view title when you hover over the page (not the sidebar). From now on you will automatically view the "page" you produce when you click on 'Save'.</li>
<li>If you want to create a taxon page view (panel view) go to 'Arguments'. Click on the plus icon to add a new argument. In the box that opens below<br />
	choose 'Taxonomy' in the drop down menu under 'Groups', check 'Taxonomy: Term ID' and click on 'Add'. If the view should only be visible when data are present select 'Hide view / Page not found' under 'Action to take if argument is not present'. Click on 'Update' and 'Save'. To be able to sort the panel you need to add a sort criterium and choose 'Weight' under 'Groups' and check 'Weight: Weight'.</li>
<li>Under 'Basic settings' click on Style: 'Unformatted' to change the view style to e.g. table or a GMap, if necessary. Click on 'Update' and 'Save'. For style examples check '<a title="View styles" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/View-styles&" target="_self">View styles</a>'.</li>
<li>If you want the view visible on a page, click on 'Add display' with 'Page' chosen in the upper left box. Click on Path: 'None' and enter the URL for this page.</li>
<li>If you want to filter your view for a certain keyword or term, add a filter, choose 'Taxonomy' &gt; 'Taxonomy: Term ID', select the vocabulary and enter the term. If you want to add a filter to the 'page' but not to the default, click on the 'Override' button.</li>
<li>Save and click on the path or open a taxon page to see the new view. It can take up to an hour for taxon page views to actually show on the taxon page because of cache issues. So be patient. </li>
</ul>
<p>
There are many more options to choose from, just be careful to frequently save. Sometimes it is useful to check the setting of other views, which are similar to the one you want to produce. <br />
