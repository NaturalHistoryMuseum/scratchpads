<li>Hover with the mouse over 'biblio' in the 'Content' menu and click on the import icon which appears to the right of the menu item. </li>
<li>Click on 'Browse' to locate and select the file containing the references into your Scratchpad.</li>
<li>Select the file type that describes your bibliographic data. The Scratchpads can import Tagged EndNote, RIS, MARC, EndNote 7 XML, EndNote 8+ XML and BibTex formatted bibliographies. These files should be prepared beforehand using the export features of the bibliographic software (e.g. EndNote) that you are using.</li>
<li>Bibliographic references are automatically tagged with taxon names held within a Scratchpad classification. This works through the keywords field, which must EXACTLY MATCH taxonomy terms listed in the Scratchpad classification. This feature needs to be activated by associating a classification with the bibliographic node type.</li>
<li>Click the ‘Import’ button once the settings have been confirmed and wait for the import process to complete (this may take several minutes for very large bibliographies). </li>
<li>Check the bibliography to ensure that the import process has completed properly. If the import process failed or is unsatisfactory, users can delete the imported bibliography using the content list accessible from the administration menu (‘Administer’ &gt; 'Advanced' &gt; ‘Content management’ &gt; ‘Content’).</li>
</ul>
