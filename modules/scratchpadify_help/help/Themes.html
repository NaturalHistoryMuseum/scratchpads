    <p>Themes define how your whole site looks. For some of the themes, like the default 'Garland' theme, you can choose your preferred 'Color scheme', with other themes you can provide you own header images, for example.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to ‘Administer’, 'Advanced', ‘Site building’, ‘<a title="Themes" href="/admin/build/themes" target="_blank">Themes</a>’.</li>
<li>From the list choose the theme you like and mark the ‘Enabled’ checkbox as well as the ‘Default’ button. </li>
<li>Click on ‘Save configuration’ and then click on ‘configure’ next to your chosen theme.</li>
<li>Choose your preferred ‘Colour scheme’ and ‘Toggle display’.</li>
<li>Upload a logo image (height up to 100 pixel) and if you like a shortcut icon.</li>
<li>Click on ‘Save configuration’.</li>
<li>Be sure you renew your screen (e.g. by clicking Ctrl+F5) to actually see the changes you made.</li>
<li>Now click on the ‘Global settings’ tab at the top of the themes page and choose the ‘Display post information on’ settings you like. You don’t need to change any of the other settings, as you already did this for the theme you chose.</li>
<li>Click on ‘Save configuration’.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the provided list there are a lot of other themes (see e.g. <a title="Drupal Themegarden" href="http://themegarden.org/drupal6/" target="_blank">http://themegarden.org/drupal6/</a>). You will need to submit a support request via the 'Issues' tab at the right side of your Scratchpad to receive support for using one of these other themes.</p>
