    <p>Menus are a collection of links (menu items) used to navigate a website.</p>
<p>To create a new menu go to ‘Administer’ &gt; ‘Layout’ &gt; ‘<a title="Menus" href="/admin/build/menu" >Menus</a>’ and click on ‘<a title="Add menu" href="/admin/build/menu/add" >Add menu</a>’. Enter the title and submit. Once you have created a menu item it also becomes a block and can be position through the <a title="Blocks" href="/admin/build/block" >blocks </a>administration page.
</p>
<p>
Go to ‘Administration’ &gt; ‘<a title="Blocks" href="/admin/build/block" >Blocks</a>’. Scroll down in the list of blocks until you find your new block under ‘Disabled’. If you want the block title to appear over the different menu items, click on ‘configure’, enter the block title and save. Scroll again down to your block and in the drop down menu where it says ‘&lt;none&gt;‘ click on ‘left sidebar’ if you want the block to appear on the left. Choose ‘Save blocks’. You can also drop and drag the block into the right position.
</p>
<p>
You can now go back to ‘menus’ and add items to your new block. Only after you have added an item to your menu it will become visible in the sidebar.
</p>
<p>
Another way to create menu items is using ‘<a title="Menu settings" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/menu-settings&" >Menu settings</a>’ under the advanced options when creating a new node. Enter a title for the menu link to this node and choose a ‘Parent item’.
</p>
<p>
Note: You can not change the 'Content' menu because it is generated automatically.
