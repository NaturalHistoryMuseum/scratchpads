  <div class="content clear-block">
    <p>By default all nodes are 'Published' and thereby visible to other people. If you uncheck 'Published' the node will not be visible to anyone but you and even you might have problems finding it again, because it doesn't show up in lists. If this happens to you, go to the basic administration menu and click on 'List' content. You still have the option to make this node accessible to some user roles via the <a title="Access" href="&amp;topic:scratchpadify_help/Access&amp;" target="_blank">'Access' tab</a>. </p>
<p>'Promoted to front page' means that if you have the default front page, which shows a list of new nodes, checking this item will make a teaser of this node show up on the front page. This does not work if you have a fixed front page. </p>
<p>'Sticky at top of lists' means that if checked, this node will appear and stay at the top of lists like the default front page or an image gallery. This is also the only way to move Scratchpad nodes into the selection of nodes for a panel (widget), which is sometimes necessary when there are too many nodes showing up in the panel and the ones you want to show are not among the selection.</p>
