    <p>Scratchpad data can be published in the journal <a title="ZooKeys journal" href="http://pensoftonline.net/zookeys/index.php/journal/index" >ZooKeys </a>by using the 'Publication' module, which is based on the 'Organic Groups' module. <span></span>A prototype for this workflow has been developed (<a title="Blagoderov et al. 2010, pdf" href="http://pensoftonline.net/zookeys/index.php/journal/article/view/539/473" >Blagoderov et al. 2010</a>). Within this workflow, the prototype of the 'Publication' module on the Scratchpads is functional, but the review process and data exchange between Scratchpads and ZooKeys are not fully automated yet and will be further developed as part of the <a title="ViBRANT" href="http://vbrant.org/" >ViBRANT project</a>. Therefore, before creating a publication, you need to be aware that it may take a while before the whole process is automated. If you do not want to wait for this, you need to ask ZooKeys whether they will accept your Scratchpad publication and if yes, coordinate with them.</p>
<p>The 'Publication' module currently allows you to select data from the biblio, image, profile, and taxon description content types and to integrate these data into the publication. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to describe new taxa in your publication you need to add temporary names for these taxa to the classification first in order to link the just mentioned data to these names. These temporary names will be visible in your classification for everybody, so choose names like <em>"Genus sp. 1"</em> or "<em>Genus sp. B"</em> to avoid confusion with 'real' names.</li>
<li>To create a publication click on the 'Add a Publication node' icon which appears when you hover over 'Publication' in the Content menu. Enter a 'Short name' and a 'Publication title'. You don't need to change the other settings. Even though 'Published' is checked under the 'Publishing options' section, nobody but group members will be able to view more than the short title of the publication (See <a title="Add a new member to a group" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/Add-a-new-member-to-a-group&" target="_self">Add a new member to a group</a><span>)</span>. Click on the 'Save' button.</li>
<li>You are now in the 'Edit' mode which has several different tab sections. Under the '<strong>Metadata</strong>' tab you can add data which are typical for all publications, like abstract and keywords. <strong>Authors </strong>are chosen from the 'Profile' content type. If you don't have a profile for an author you need to click on the 'Create author' button and enter the data you need. Under 'Institution' enter the full address which is to appear in the paper, not just the institution name. Save. To select authors for the publication click on the 'Edit publication authors' button. The available authors are listed at the bottom. Click on an author to select him/her. The name will now appear in the upper left box (note that the title of the author will not appear in the publication). Use the buttons below the box to sort authors or use drag and drop. Click on the 'Save' button. Always click the 'Save' button before you leave a tab section.</li>
<li>Click on the '<strong>Taxa</strong>' tab. Select a classification, extend the classification by clicking on the plus icons and select the taxa which you want to include in your publication. Save.</li>
<li>Click on the 'Default fields' tab. Here you can select the fields from the '<a title="Taxon description" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/Taxon-description&" target="_self"><strong>Taxon Description</strong></a>' content type that you want to show in your publication by default. These will usually be the fields you have actually filled in. You need to add 'Taxon descriptions' for each of the taxa for which you want to include descriptions in your publication. We recommend to use the 'Morphology' field for the actual morphological description of the taxon and 'Diagnostic Description' for the diagnoses.<span></span> Save.</li>
<li>Click on the 'Sections' tab. You can see a list of the taxa you selected including a taxon description for each. <br />
<ul>
<li>Click on 'Edit' next to a taxon term to enter the <strong>final published name</strong> for this taxon in case of new taxa. This is also the place to enter citation data if the taxon has been cited elsewhere, and the <strong>type material</strong>. Save.</li>
<li>Click on 'Edit term fields' next to a taxon description to select the fields from the '<strong>Taxon Description</strong>' content type that you want to show only for this taxon. The default fields are preselected.</li>
<li>Click on the 'Add section' link below the blue box to add new custom sections like "Introduction" or "Discussion".</li>
<li>Drag and drop to re-arrrange the different sections using the cross icons in front of each section. Dropping slightly to the right will create a hierarchical order.</li>
<li>Save.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click on the 'Images' tab. <br />
<ul>
<li>To add new <strong>images </strong>click on 'Create images', enter the respective data, tag it to the classification, and browse for the image. Make sure that under the 'Advanced options' at the bottom, when you click on the 'Access' tab, your publication short title is selected and 'Public' unselected. This will create an image accessibly only to group members until the paper is published.<span> <br /></span></li>
<li>To select the images you want to include in the publication click on 'Edit publication images'. Select an image by clicking on its thumbnail. Click on 'Filter items' to filter for images of certain taxa. The title of the images will appear in the upper box. Drag and drop the titles into the correct order. Save.</li>
<li>To add figure captions click on an image thumbnail and enter the caption into the box. Save. Images with captions are marked with a yellow quadrangle in the upper right corner of the thumbnail. Save.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click on the '<strong>Bibliography</strong>' section. This work the same way as the image section, but you have more options for filtering for specific references. Make sure to sort you references alphabetically by clicking on the 'Desc.' button before you save.</li>
<li>The last tab is the 'Privacy' tab, which allows you to edit your 'Publication' settings. You don't need to change any of the default settings. </li>
<li>Click on 'View' to preview your publication and check for errors or missing data. 'Edit' the publication to add or correct data if necessary. The data are transferred to the journal via XML, so it is also useful to click on 'XML' to check for missing data (In most browsers you will not see XML unless you select "View Source"<span>)</span>. Especially the bibliographic references can miss some of the rarer fields, so if any fields you need are missing, you need to contact us at <a href="mailto:scratchpad@nhm.ac.uk">scratchpad@nhm.ac.uk</a>. The 'Export' function is not working, yet.<span> So you need to save the XML (right click and 'Save link as') and send it to ZooKeys by email.</span></li>
<li><span>The 'Make public' button will make all data connected to a publication public, so this button should only be pressed AFTER the printed version of the publication has been published by ZooKeys to avoid confusion about the availability of new names. You will be notified by ZooKeys when this has happened.<br /></span></li>
