    <p>We currently offer the option to export taxon descriptions, as well as images and biblios attached to the respective taxon, to EOL. </p>
<ul>
<li>To export data from your Scratchpad, you need to sign up as a content partner with EOL at <a href="http://www.eol.org/content/partners" title="http://www.eol.org/content/partners">http://www.eol.org/content/partners</a>.</li>
<li>Fill in all the necessary fields and under 'Manage resources' create a new resource description. </li>
<li>Enter a title and under 'Indicate below the full URL...' enter "XXX/spm/export.xml" (replace the "XXX" with the URL of your Scratchpad!). Fill in the other fields as you see fit. As 'default rights holder' you should enter your full name. Click the 'Create resource' button.</li>
<li>Your resource will now show up on the 'Manage resources' page. For testing purposes you can click the 'Force' link, which ensures that EOL will harvest your data during the next night (sometimes it takes longer).</li>
<li>If you don't change the settings on your Scratchpad, EOL will harvest all taxon descriptions. If you want to export only selected descriptions, go to the advanced administration menu of your Scratchpad and click on 'Taxon page export' in the site configuration section. All species that have taxon descriptions will show up. Select the taxa that you want to export and click on the 'Save configuration' button.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the Scratchpads 2.0 upgrade we plan to improve the export and for example create an option to select which images to export to EOL or to export images and biblios for taxa that have no taxon description.</p>
