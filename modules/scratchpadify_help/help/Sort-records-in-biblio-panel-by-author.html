    <p>When you click on the 'Authors' header in the biblio panel on a taxon page, the biblio nodes should be sorted by author. However, this doesn't work because the sorting is actually done on the node number of the author and not on the alphabet. The only way to fix this is to remove the hyperlinks to the authors. If you do this it also means that you will not be able to just click on an author to see a list of biblios with this author. However, you can still filter for author on the biblio page.</p>
<p>To remove author hyperlinks go to Administer &gt; Advanced &gt; Biblio Settings (.../admin/settings/biblio) and in the 'Links' section unselect 'Hyperlink author names'. Save.</p>
