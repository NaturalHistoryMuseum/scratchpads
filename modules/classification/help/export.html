<h2>Classification Export Instructions</h2>
<p>On the Export tab, select vocabulary and file format, click the button "Export" and your full classification (along with its synonyms) will be exported to the text file of <a href="import?popup=1">"Parend-child" format</a> or to the compressed (Gzipped) TCS (Taxon Concept Schema) XML format appropriate for import to EOL. Text file is easy enough to open in any spreadsheet editor like MS Excel or OpenOffice.org Calc. Gzipped XML file will be saved to your computer <b>and</b> to the server at the same time.</p>
<p>Please note that export could take a long time if you are using a large classification (thouthsands of taxa).</p>
