<term>
<name>General Description</name>
<description> A comprehensive description of the characteristics of the taxon. To be used primarily when many of the subject categories are treated together in one object, but at length. Taxon biology is to be used if a brief summary.</description>

<term>
<name>Conservation Status</name>
<description> A description of the likelihood of the species becoming extinct in the present day or in the near future. Population size is treated under Population Biology, and trends in population sizes are treated under Trends. However, this is the preferred element if an object includes all of these things and details about conservation listings.</description>
