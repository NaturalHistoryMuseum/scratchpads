<p>There are three search options: simple, taxonomy, and advanced.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple search: This is the default. Enter a term in the search field and click on ‘Go!’. This will give you all instances where this term occurs on the site.</li>
<li>Taxonomy search: Click on ‘Taxonomy’ above the search field and wait until a circle appears on the right side of the field. Then start entering a term used in the taxonomy/classification on this site. As you type, terms will (slowly) be listed underneath the field and you can choose the correct one. If no terms appear your word is not part of the taxonomy. Click on ‘Go’. You will usually get a taxon page. If not you will get a list of all the nodes which are tagged with this term.</li>
<li>Advanced search: Click the ‘Go’ button without entering anything in the search box. This will reveal the ‘Advanced search’ options. Enter your search term and choose the category or type of data you want to search, e.g. check ‘biblio’ if you only want to search for bibliographic citations.</li>
