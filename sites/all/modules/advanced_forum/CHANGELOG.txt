* Created this changelog to help early adopters keep up with my changes. Will only be recording major changes until the module gets non-dev releases.
* Notable recent changes:
 - Moved all theme related files into themes/advforum to enable alternate themes
 - Removed call to _is_forum() at the top of node-forum.tpl.php and rolled logic into the function
 - Renamed node-forum.tpl.php to forum-thread.tpl.php
