    <p>Structured Descriptive Data (SDD) can be used to generate interactive keys or taxon descriptions. To generate an interactive key from a character project, the data have to be exported to SDD and the SDD file needs to be imported into key generating software like <a title="Lucid" href="http://www.lucidcentral.org/" >Lucid</a>.</p>
<p>Only controlled and numeric characters can be exported into SDD, not text characters.</p>
<p>Warning:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Importing the SDD file into Lucid software only works with Lucid 3.4 and 3.5, not 3.3. To export into Lucid 3.3 use the Lucid Interchange Form (LIF),</li>
<li>Your taxa all need to have the same rank in the classification. Otherwise the import doesn't work. </li>
</ul>
