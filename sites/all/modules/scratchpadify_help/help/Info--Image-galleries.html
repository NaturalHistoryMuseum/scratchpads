    <p>To create an image gallery click on the 'Add a Image node' icon in the Content menu and then click on 'Add a new image gallery' below the Image gallery drop down box. Give the gallery a name and description. Under the 'Advanced options' you can choose a parent image gallery or a 'weight' for the gallery to determine its position relative to other image galleries. The default gallery is simply called 'Library'.
</p>
<p>Image gallery names are part of the image gallery vocabulary. If you want to edit a gallery name or delete a gallery you need to do this via 'Taxonomy' in the Content menu.
