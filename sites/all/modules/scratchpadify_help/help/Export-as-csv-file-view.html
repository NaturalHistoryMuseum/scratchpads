    <p>There is module that enables you to create a view that will export data from a content type as csv file. You need to contact us if you want this module enabled on your site.</p>
<p>To create this new view go to the views administration page and edit the view for the content type you want to export.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a new "Feed" display</li>
<li>Under 'Basic settings' change the 'Style' to "CSV file". Under the 'Style options' choose "Provide file" and give a file name like "XXX.csv". Update and save.</li>
<li>The 'Items to display' should be "0"</li>
<li>Under 'Feed settings' enter a path.</li>
<li>Remove any 'Arguments'</li>
<li>Under 'Fields' add those fields you want to export. If necessary you need to create relationships to add fields from content types linked to the current content type.</li>
<li>Save.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you go to the path (URL) for the export you will have the option to open or download the file. If you open directly in Excel you can get problems with diacritics, which don't occur in other programs.</p>
