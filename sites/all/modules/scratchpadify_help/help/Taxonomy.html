    <p>The taxonomy module contains controlled vocabularies. A vocabulary is a kind of box or container, that contains a set of terms. These terms do not have to be taxonomic names. Country lists, keywords etc. can all be treated as "taxonomies" in the context of your site. Vocabularies are the backbone of a Scratchpad and link together the content. They are used to generate taxon pages.</p>
