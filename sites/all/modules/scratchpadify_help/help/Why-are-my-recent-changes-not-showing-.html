    <p>Scratchpads use a cache system, which is a temporary storage area where some data are stored for rapid access. Once the data is stored in the cache, it can be used in the future by accessing the cached copy rather than re-fetching or recomputing the original data. This can save a lot of time. However, it also means that sometimes you or unauthenticated users are not able to see recent changes to the Scratchpad. Usually you have to wait between one hour and a day for certain changes to become visible to everybody. Only the administrators of the Scratchpad team are able to clear the cache for you.<br /><br />
In some cases it helps to rebuild the screen by pressing Control+F5, but not always.</p>
