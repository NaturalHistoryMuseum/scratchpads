    <p>By default all Scratchpad taxonomies have four basic fields: the term name, parent, description and synonyms. This is not really enough when dealing with biological classifications. We have therefore developed a special way to deal with biological classifications that follows the standards used by the <a title="ITIS standards" href="http://www.itis.gov/submit.html" >Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS)</a> and is compatibel with other initiatives. We have created a special 'ITIS name' content type, that is connected in a one to one relationship with the vocabulary that hold the classification. <strong>You need to connect your classification to the 'ITIS name' content type when you add (or edit) your vocabulary!</strong></p>
<p>You can either add your names one by one using the <a title="Edit a classification/taxonomy" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/Edit-a-classification-taxonomy&" target="_self">taxonomic editor</a>, <a title="Import a classification/taxonomy" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/Import-a-classification-taxonomy&" target="_self">import </a>from EOL, or import a custom made table. If you create your own table you can use one of <a title="File types" href="&topic:csv_import/filetypes&">two file types</a>:&nbsp; '<a title="Parent/child file type" href="&topic:csv_import/parentchild&">Parent/Child</a>' or '<a title="Full hierarchy file type" href="&topic:csv_import/fullhierarchy&">Full hierarchy</a>'. </p>
<p>The file can have the following fields (fields marked with '*' are required): </p>
<ul>
<li>unit_ind1: <span style="color: black;">Indicator of an occurrence of a plant hybrid at the generic level. The only value allowed is "X".<br /></span></li>
<li>unit_name1*: <span style="color: black;">The singular or first part of a scientifically accepted label for an occurrence of Taxonomic Units. </span>For  uninomials (1-part names like family or genus names) this will be the only name field entered. For binomials/polynomials, this field will be used for the first part of the name (the genus name). The names in this position require the initial letter to be capitalized.</li>
<li>unit_ind2: <span style="color: black;">A category indicator positioned between the first and second parts of a binomial/polynomial taxonomic name. </span><span style="color: black;">The only value allowed is "X".</span></li>
<li>unit_name2: <span style="color: black;">The second part of a scientifically accepted label for a binomial/polynomial occurrence of Taxonomic Units (the species epithet).</span></li>
<li>unit_ind3: <span style="color: black;">A category indicator located within a polynomial taxonomic name. Allowed values are: "ssp." (plants and fungi), "subsp." (animals and monerans),</span> "var.", "subvar.", "f.", "subf.",<span> and "X".<span> </span><br /></span></li>
<li>unit_name3: <span style="color: black;">The third portion of a scientifically accepted label for a polynomial occurrence of Taxonomic Units (e.g. subspecies name).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: black;">unit_ind4: Same as unit_ind3.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: black;">unit_name4: Same as unit_name4.<br /></span></li>
<li>taxon_author: <span style="color: black;">The author(s) associated with the name of a taxon. This can include the year of publication and brackets, e.g. "(Quoy and Gaimard, 1832)<span>".</span></span> </li>
<li>rank_name: <span style="color: black;">The label associated with the specific level of a taxonomic hierarchy, e.g. "Family", "Genus" or "Species". For values check <a title="ITIS standards" href="http://www.itis.gov/submit.html" >ITIS </a>or the taxonomic editor for an existing classification on your site. <strong>Note that the spelling and capitalisation of the ranks in your import file must match the ranks in the Scratchpad!</strong></span> </li>
<li>usage*: <span style="color: black;">Current standing of an occurrence of Taxonomic Units. Allowed values are: "accepted" (plants and fungi),</span> "not accepted" (plants and fungi), "valid" (animals and monerans)<span>, and "invalid" (animals and monerans)<span>.</span></span> </li>
<li>parent_name*: An ITIS term denoting the taxon that is the next highest level from the subject valid or accepted taxon. <span>&nbsp;</span>The parent of a species is usually a genus; the parent of a genus is usually a family, and so on. This parent-child linkage between records is the basis for the classification hierarchy in ITIS.
<ul>
<li>Import rules: All valid/accepted names must have one and only one "parent". <strong>The format for the "parent" entry in a given record is to include the full name AND author (if applicable) of the parent in one field</strong>. </li>
<li>Examples: "Species=Homo sapiens; enter parent=Homo Linnaeus, 1758", "Genus=Arum; enter parent=Araceae (this family does not have an author in ITIS)<span>"</span></li>
<li><span>Synonyms: For the Scratchpad import synonyms also need to have a parent, which will determine its place in the hierarchy. Usually a synonym is shown as child term of the accepted name, so parent and accepted name are the same. It is also possible to add a synonym as sister taxon to the valid name, however, during import the taxa on one rank level are sorted alphabetical, so in the classification tree it will not be possible to see which is the valid name for a synonym.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>accepted_name: The scientific name of the valid or accepted taxon identified as the currently accepted name used for a given invalid or not accepted name. Each name that is in synonymy (junior synonyms, obsolete combinations, etc.) must be connected to one accepted or valid name.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Import rules: In contrast to the "parent" links (see above), <strong>only the scientific name not the author values must be entered</strong> in this field. This is different from the ITIS standard.<span>&nbsp;</span><br /></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>unacceptability_reason:&nbsp;An explanation regarding why a given scientific name is judged to be invalid or not accepted. Unacceptability reasons vary among&nbsp; kingdoms.<span> </span><span style="color: black;">For values check <a title="ITIS standards" href="http://www.itis.gov/submit.html" >ITIS </a>or the taxonomic editor for an existing classification on your site. </span><strong><span style="color: black;">Note that the spelling and capitalisation of the reasons in your import file must match those in the Scratchpad!</span></strong> </li>
<li>page_number<span>: The page number the taxon was described on in the protologue. This field is not part of the ITIS standard.</span></li>
<li><span>vernacular_name: Enter vernacular names for this taxon, comma-separated.</span><span> This field is not part of the ITIS standard.</span></li>
<li><span>'custom fields': You can import more fields, like for example 'type information', but you must add these fields to the 'ITIS Name' content type before you import.<br /></span></li>
