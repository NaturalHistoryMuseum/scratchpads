    <p>Now we are going to add a separate page.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Click on the 'Add display' button, with 'Page' chosen in the drop down box. Under ‘Page settings’ click on Path: 'None', enter the URL (content/citation2) and update. </li>
<li>Under ‘Basic settings’ click on ‘Use pager’, click on the ‘Override’ button to be able to have a different setting for this page than for the default we did earlier, select ‘Full pager’ and update. The pager enables you to click through several pages of citations instead of having one long list. Set the ‘Items to display’ to "10" and click the 'Override' button if necessary (it is not necessary if the button reads 'Use default'). Update and save. </li>
<li>Make sure you are still on the 'Page' display. Each time you save you go back to the Default settings and need to click on the 'Page' setting again. We need to remove the argument in order to show citations for all taxa on this page. Click on your argument, then on the 'Override' button, click on 'Remove' and save. </li>
<li>Make sure you are on the 'Page' display. If you want to check your new view click on 'View "Page"' in the upper right corner. You can go back to editing the view by clicking on the light grey '[Edit]' link which appears below the view title when you hover over the page (not the sidebar). From now on you will automatically view the "page" you produce when you click on 'Save'. </li>
<li>We want the user to search for taxon names and/or citation keywords. To do this we need to add two filters to our page view. Under ‘Filters’ click on the plus icon, choose 'Taxonomy' &gt; 'Taxonomy: Term', select the Carnidae classification and update. Click on the 'Override' button and on the ‘Expose’ button so that users can see the filter. Select ‘Unlock operator’, enter the label “Search for: Taxonomic name”, uncheck ‘Force single’ and update. Save. Add another filter for the citation keywords and save. </li>
<li>Try out your new view. You can search for multiple terms when you separate terms with a comma.
</li>
</ul>
