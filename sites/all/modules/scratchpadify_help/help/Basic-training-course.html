    <p>The focus of the basic course lies on adding various kinds of data and generating taxon pages. Our goal is to provide a taste of what the sites can do, and allow you to independently explore the Scratchpad after the event.</p>
<p>For an online training course, keep the training window open next to a window with the training site.</p>
<p>The instructions are written for use with special <strong>training sites</strong>. The training sites are provided for the courses we teach, but are also available <a title="Contact us" href="http://scratchpads.eu/contact">on request</a> if you want to do the course on your own. You can also do the course on the <a title="Scratchpad sandbox" href="http://sandbox.scratchpads.eu/" >Sandbox</a> (username: test, password: pass). If you use the sandbox you must be prepared that other users may change the site at the same time and you must be aware that the sandbox is rebuilt every 6 hours. So best start just after it was rebuilt. What you see on the sandbox will differ from the training sites only in the 'Log in' section at the start of the course.</p>
<p>If you participate in one of our courses, your training site is established at: <a href="http://trainingXX.taxon.name" title="http://trainingXX.taxon.name">http://trainingXX.taxon.name</a></p>
<p>Replace the 'XX' with the number that you have been issued. Log in with the following credentials:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Username:username</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Password: password<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Training files</strong> can be downloaded from <a title="Trainingfiles" href="http://scratchpads.eu/scratchpad-training-files" >http://scratchpads.eu/scratchpad-training-files</a>. Either keep this page open in a separate tab in your browser or download and unzip '<a title="Training files" href="path:Training_files.zip" >Training_Files.zip</a>'. </p>
<p>Browser: For the course please use the <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong> browser which can be downloaded from <a title="Mozilla Firefox" href="http://www.mozilla.com/" >http://www.mozilla.com</a>. If you don't have administrative rights on your computer you can use <a title="Portable Firefox" href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable" >Portable Firefox</a>. </p>
<p>The aim of this course will be to create a taxonomic website for the fly family Carnidae, specifically a species page for the bird parasite <em>Carnus hemapterus</em>. You can see what your training site might look like at the end of the basic and advanced course at <a title="Example Carnidae training site" href="http://carnidae.myspecies.info" >http://carnidae.myspecies.info</a>.</p>
