    <p>Typical uses for Webform are questionnaires, contact or request/register forms, surveys, polls or a front end to issues tracking systems.
</p>
<p>Submissions from a webform are saved in a database table and can optionally be mailed to a nominated e-mail address upon submission. Past submissions are viewable for users with the correct permissions.</p>
<p>Webform includes some simple statistical tools to help in form design and evaluation and also allows the whole table to be downloaded as a csv file for detailed statistical analysis.</p>
<p><strong>When to use Webform instead of CCK</strong><br /><br />
Webform can be used when performing data collection that is a <strong>one-way</strong> communication, that is, many users submitting values to a very small set of administrators. Webform is <strong>not</strong> a front end for letting users create custom nodes. For this you can use custom content types. <strong>Webform submissions are not nodes</strong>. This means that you can't use Views with submissions, setup custom access permissions to submissions, or do just about anything with them outside of what Webform provides for you.</p>
<p>Webform is however, a fantastic and easy solution for websites that need to create many regularly changing forms. Webform doesn't require you to setup a content type for each different form, instead each form is tied to a particular node.
