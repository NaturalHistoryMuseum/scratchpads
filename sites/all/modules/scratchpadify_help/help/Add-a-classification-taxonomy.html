<li>Click on 'Taxonomy' in the 'Content' menu and click on ‘<a title="Add vocabulary" href="/admin/content/taxonomy/add/vocabulary" >Add vocabulary</a>’.
	</li>
<li>
	Enter a ‘Vocabulary name’ and ‘Description’. For a biological classification extend the 'Settings' section. If you have content which relates to several terms in your classification/taxonomy, select ‘Multiple select’. Under 'Content type' select 'ITIS name' in the drop down menu.</li>
<li>
	Select the ‘Content types’ which can be tagged with this classification. By default all content types are selected. Remember that every time you add a new content type you will have to go back to this page to enable this new content type to be tagged.
	</li>
<li>
	Check the settings. If you have content which relates to several terms in your classification/taxonomy, select ‘Multiple select’.
	</li>
<li>
	Save.

<li>
	If you want to import an existing classification:
<ul>
<li>
		Click on ‘Import’ and click on the name of your new classification.
		</li>
<li>Select the type of import.</li>
<li>
		If you want to import a file with your own classification, click on ‘CSV File’. Click on the little questionmark icon for further instructions.</li>
<li>If you want to import a classification from the web click on 'EOL'.</li>
<li>Enter the highest taxonomic name you want to import. This must be a parent of all the taxa imported. Click on the 'Search' button.</li>
<li>Select one of the found classifications and click the 'Import from EOL' button. Depending on how many taxa you imported it will take a while to upload all of them. When the import is finished a tinytax block with your classification will appear in the sidebar. If not refresh your browser window.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
	If you established a classification which allowed ‘Free tagging’ (by checking 'Tags' under the settings) you don’t need to import or add terms.
	</li>
<li>
	Your new classification will automatically appear in the sidebar when you have added terms.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
When creating content users will be able to tag content of those content types you selected to the new classification.</p>
<p>
Tip: If you want to add a batch of new taxa to your classification, you can just import the file with the new taxa into your existing vocabulary as described above. The root taxon of the imported classification will appear below the existing classification. Go to the 'Editor' to drag and drop the new taxa to the correct place. Delete duplicate taxa but be careful not to delete taxa from the old classification because if any data on your Scratchpad have been tagged to these terms, you will lose the tagging information. This is because the each term is a node with a node number and content is linked to the node and not the term word.</p>
<p>When you have finished moving all taxa to the correct place, refresh the browser window. The classification block should now show the correct classification.<span> </span></p>
