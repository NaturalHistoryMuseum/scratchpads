    <p>The biblio module is for creating a bibliography on your Scratchpad. </p>
<p>To add a biblio node - that is a bibliographic citation - you need to first select the publication type. Usually this will be 'Journal Article', 'Book' or 'Book chapter', but there are other types as well. Alternatively, you can add a bibliographic record from the 'DOI' number of the publication, or by cutting and pasting the 'BibTex' record.</p>
<p>When you select a publication type, a set of fields relevant to this type appears. Fill in the fields you need and save.</p>
