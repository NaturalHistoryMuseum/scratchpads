The organic groups module enables the generation of private groups within a Scratchpad. Subscribing to a group gives access to this private space. It can be used to cooperate on specific projects, for example writing or reviewing a paper, or for sharing data, etc. </p>
<p>The creator of a group is usually the manager of the group, but he can also hand this responsibility to another user. The manager can edit the group's settings, unblock new subscribers and change <a title="User roles" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/User-roles&" target="_self">user roles</a>. Within a group users can have the same or a higher user role than on the rest of the Scratchpad. Be aware that even though you might have for example a contributor role for a group this doesn’t give you all the rights a user has which is contributor for the whole Scratchpad. For example you can’t create a new group.</p>
<p><strong>By default, content added to a group will only be visible to group members not to other users</strong>. If you want group content to be public you can select 'Public' (as well as the group) under the 'Access' tab of the advanced options for the respective node. If you decide at some point to make all the content in a group public, you can delete the group. This will not delete the content in the group but instead make it public. This option can be useful if you use a group to prepare content for a paper and want to make the content public after the paper has been published.</p>
<p>To delete a group and make the content public, go back to your group's main page, for example via the 'Group' link in the Content menu and clicking on the 'My groups' tab. Edit the group and click on the 'Delete' button. You will be asked what you want to do with the group's posts. Select 'Do nothing' and click on the 'Delete group' button. Your group is now deleted and all the content which belonged to this group is publicly available on your site.</p>
<p>As long as you are on the main group page, content added via the Content menu will be added to this group. You can also activate the 'Group details' block by moving it to a sidebar. This block is useful, because it enables you to add content to the group from all nodes that belong to the group and to add new members to your group by clicking on the '1 member' (or 2, 3, ... members) menu item.</p>
