It might be confusing to know what to do when you work with the views (panels) on the taxon pages. You have to first click on the title of the item in the panel to go to the respective page and only then you can edit it.
</p>
<p>
To edit pages other users created you need to have the role of editor or you can ask the respective creator to give you access to this page.

<h3>Matrix editor</h3>
<p>You also have the option to edit the content of several nodes of the same content type at once using the matrix editor. </p>
<ul>
<li>To open the matrix editor go to the Content menu and hover with the mouse over the content type you want to edit, e.g. 'Image'. Click on the 'Edit image nodes in a grid layout' icon to open the matrix editor. You will see a matrix with a row for each node - in this case each image - and columns for selected fields of this content type. The rows are ordered chronologically, with the most recent images at the top.</li>
<li>To edit content click into the field and edit the content. Then press the ‘Save’ button. To edit the content of several nodes at once, select the rows you need by checking the box at the start of the row and then click into the field you want to change. When you save, the content of this field will be the same in all selected nodes. Remember to unselect the rows before you continue with other rows. Unselecting can be done one by one or by checking the box at the start of the header row twice, once for selecting all nodes and once for unselecting all.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>To filter for certain content, start typing into the search field below the column header. As you type less and less nodes will show.</li>
<li>Sort nodes by clicking on the header of the column you want to sort by.</li>
<li>To adapt which columns to show, right click on the header row and select the fields you want to show.</li>
<li>Change the width of columns by dragging the double bar at the right of the column header.</li>
<li>Near the bottom of the matrix is a bar which you can drag and drop to change the height of the matrix.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the matrix you can select how many nodes to show. At the right side a green check mark appears when you have successfully edited the matrix and a red cross if there were problems. Hover with the mouse over these icons for more information. There is also an undo icon in case you want to go back a step.</li>
</ul>
