    <p>Image galleries provide you with a way to show images in one or more groups that can differ from the classification(s) on the site.</p>
<p>For example if you have a Scratchpad based on a biological classification of your group, the usual way to show images of a taxon would be via the taxon pages. However, using the image gallery option you can group images differently, for example into a gallery only for primary types, for a certain developmental stage or for a certain author.</p>
