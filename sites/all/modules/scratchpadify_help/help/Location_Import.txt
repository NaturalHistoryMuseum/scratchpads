2323423	Europe	Greece			Thessalonìki		Kerkini, Lithotopos, Ecotourism Site			41.138	23.217	on label	This is a reasonably anthropogenic site, being set in a fallow field adjacent to the Centre for the Promotion of Ecotourism in Lithotopos. There is a small amount of building refuse on the site and it has been irregularly grazed for many years. The ground is stony, with a few trees around, mostly Paliuris spinichristi. The vegetation is otherwise mixed herbaceous/graminaceous and contains quite a few flowering plants. The soil is thin, the ground is stony and it has a north facing aspect. (G. Ramel)	65	
2323424	Europe	Greece			Thessalonìki		Kerkini, Pumping St. Site			41.214	23.103	on label	This was within the fenced off area surrounding a pumping station that moved water out of the lake and into the canal system for the western side of the lake. It was relatively ungrazed, and stood adjacent to a canal bordered with willows and reeds. It was moist site producing lush grasses, which is why somebody managed to arrange to have their horses put inside the fence. The horses got caught up in the guys supporting the trap and, in disentangling themselves, did serious damage to the trap, they also changed the habitat by eating all the grass and dunging all over. This was the trap from sites 2 & 6 and it was getting old anyway, the horse damage proved irreparable so the trap was discontinued. (G. Ramel)	40	
2323418	Europe	Greece			Thessalonìki		North slope of Krousia Mountains, Kerkini			41.192	23.067	on label	This trap was on the lower, north facing slopes of the Krousia mountains. It was situated immediately beside a large stack of cut timber (mostly oak), with a number of other stacks nearby. The immediate vegetation was Paliuris spinichristi and Carpinus orientalus. A little further off 20+metres there was a mixed deciduous forest, dominated by Downy Oak (Quercus pubescens). This trap was occasionally baited with freshly cut branches and or rotting fruit. It was taken down shortly after the timber was removed. (G. Ramel)	190	
2323419	Europe	Greece			Thessalonìki		Kerkini, Procom Site			41.377	23.366	on label	This trap is situated in a glade created by a massive fallen tree in a riverine forest along the banks of the River Bistristisas, a tributary of the Strymon running out of Mt Orbellis. The trap is north of the village of Promohonas and half a kilometer from the shopping complex of Procom. At this point the river delineates the Greek border with Bulgaria. The forest is continuous for some kilometers and extant on both sides of the river. It is grazed very little, if at all, (by goats), and relatively untouched - no logging in the last 50 years at least. However the understory vegetation is seriously effected by regular inundations during flooding in spring and early summer. The dominant trees are White Poplar, wild Walnut and Hazelnut while the lower vegetation is dominated by brambles (Rubus sp.) and Equisetum maximum that grows to a height of 1.7 metres by late July.
