    <h4>Taxonomic editor</h4>
<ul>
<li>To open the new taxonomic editor, click on '<a title="Taxonomy" href="/admin/content/taxonomy" >Taxonomy</a>' in the Content menu, find the classification you wish to edit in the list and click on 'Editor' (not 'Edit classification'). </li>
<li>On the right side of the taxonomic editor, which is called the 'form' side, you see some instructions on how to use the editor. On the left side, which is called the 'tree' side, you will see the root taxon of this classification. </li>
<li>Extend the classification by clicking on the plus icon next to a term. Click on the term itself to edit this term. As soon as you click on a term a form opens on the right side of the editor. Depending on whether or not you linked your classification to a certain content type, e.g. the 'ITIS Name' content type, different fields will be visible in the form. The screenshot below is from a classification using the 'ITIS Name' content type. The uninominal or binominal taxonomic name will appear to the upper right corner of the editor.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tree side</h4>
<ul>
<li>On the left side of the editor you see the classification tree. Taxa with child taxa have a plus icon in front of the name. Click on the plus to view the child taxa. The plus will be replaced by a minus icon. Click on the minus if you want to compress the tree again.</li>
<li>If information on the validity of the names is available, valid names are displayed in black, invalid names in red.</li>
<li>Above the tree there is a row of useful icons. Hover with the mouse over the icons to see an explanation.</li>
<li>You can move taxa around the tree via drag and drop. This only changes the position of the name, not it's associated data, so if you move a species from one genus to another, the genus name of the term will stay the same. Also if you move a species into synonymy, you need to change the validity information in a separate step. If you made a mistake use the 'Undo move' button to retract your moves.</li>
<li>Use the 'Previous' and 'Next' icons to quickly move from taxon to taxon.</li>
<li>Use the 'Add term' icon to add a new name. The name will be added as a child to the currently selected taxon. If there is no taxon selected the new term will be added as a root taxon. Be aware that if you add a second name, it will be added as child to the first name, because this name is still selected. You need to select the parent term first if you want a different one. However, you can always move taxa around later by drag and drop.</li>
<li>If you want to give a link to a certain term to another user with editor or maintainer role on your site, click the 'Link to this page' icon and copy and paste the link into your email or website.</li>
<li>To search for a term click on the 'Search' icon, enter the name in the autocomplete field and click on the binocular icon. The tree will be extended to show the term and it will be highlighted in yellow for a few seconds.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Form side</h4>
<ul>
<li>Depending on whether your classification is linked to a certain content type, e.g. the 'ITIS Name' content type, different fields will be visible in the form. The different tabs represent the groups into which the fields are ordered. </li>
<li>For an explanation of the 'ITIS Name' fields see '<a title="Add and import an ITIS standard taxonomy?" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/add-and-import-itis-standard-taxonomy&" >Add and import an ITIS standard taxonomy?</a>'. In short, the 'Unit Name 1' is a uninominal name, e.g. family or genus name. 'Unit Name 2' is the species epithet and 'Unit Name 3' is for trinominals, for example the subspecies epithet. Indicators pop up when data have been entered into the corresponding unit name field. 'Unit Indicators' 1 &amp; 2 are only for plant hybrids, 3 is for indicating whether a trinominal is a subspecies or variety, for example. The 'Authors' field includes the full authority with authors, year and brackets if needed. Under 'Reference' the term can be linked to the respective biblio citation if available on the site.</li>
<li>Click the 'Save' button before you move to another taxon if you made any changes. Otherwise you will loose the changes.</li>
