    <p>Generally, all imported data need to be in a spreadsheet format, with a column for each field and a row for each record. A header row with the correct field names as they appear in the Scratchpad, facilitates the import. The spreadsheet needs to be saved as a comma- or tab-delimited file in UTF-8 format. Exceptions are bibliographic citations, which are imported in special bibliographic formats, and images, which are uploaded as image files, e.g. jpg.</p>
