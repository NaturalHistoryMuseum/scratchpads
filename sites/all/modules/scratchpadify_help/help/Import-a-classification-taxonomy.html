    <ul>
<li>Click on 'Taxonomy' in the 'Content' menu and click on the 'Import' tab at the top.</li>
<li>Select the vocabulary into which you want to import.</li>
<li>There are three different options for importing your taxonomy, two of which are explained here:</li>
<li>CSV file: If you want to import your own classification and have prepared a <a title="Create an ITIS standard taxonomy" href="&topic:scratchpadify_help/Create-an-ITIS-standard-taxonomy&" target="_self">table in CSV or tab delimited format</a>:
<ul>
<li>
		Click on â€˜CSV file'.
		</li>
<li>Upload your file and select the file type.</li>
<li>Press the 'Import from CSV file' button and wait until the import finishes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>EOL: If you want to import a classification from the web click on 'EOL'.
<ul>
<li>Enter the highest taxonomic name you want to import. This must be a parent of all the taxa imported. Click on the 'Search' button.</li>
<li>Select one of the found classifications and click the 'Import from EOL' button. Depending on how many taxa you imported it will take a while to upload all of them. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When the import is finished a tinytax block with your classification will appear in the sidebar. If not refresh your browser window.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Tip: If you want to add a batch of new taxa to your classification, you can just import the file with the new taxa into your existing vocabulary as described above. The root taxon of the imported classification will appear below the existing classification. Go to the 'Editor' to drag and drop the new taxa to the correct place. Delete duplicate taxa but be careful not to delete taxa from the old classification because if any data on your Scratchpad have been tagged to these terms, you will lose the tagging information. This is because the each term is a node with a node number and content is linked to the node and not the term word.</p>
