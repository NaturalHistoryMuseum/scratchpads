    <p>The online training courses are intended to help current and prospective Scratchpad owners develop their site building skills. Keep the training window open next to a window with the training site.</p>
<p>The manuals for the basic and the advanced training course are specifically written for use with special <strong>training sites</strong>. However, you can also do them on your own on the <a title="Scratchpad sandbox" href="http://sandbox.scratchpads.eu/" >Sandbox</a> (username: test, password: pass). If you use the sandbox you must be prepared that other users may change the site at the same time and you must be aware that the sandbox is rebuild every 6 hours. So best start just after it was rebuild. What you see on the sandbox will differ from the training sites only in the 'Log in' section at the start of the course.</p>
<p><strong>Training files</strong> can be downloaded from <a title="Trainingfiles" href="http://scratchpads.eu/scratchpad-training-files" >http://scratchpads.eu/scratchpad-training-files</a>. Either keep this page open in a separate tab in your browser or download and unzip the files you need. </p>
<p>Browser: For the course please use the <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong> browser which can be downloaded from <a title="Mozilla Firefox" href="http://www.mozilla.com/" >http://www.mozilla.com</a>. If you don't have administrative rights on your computer you can use <a title="Portable Firefox" href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable" >Portable Firefox</a>. </p>
<p>The aim of this course will be to create a taxonomic website for the fly family Carnidae, specifically a species page for the bird parasite <em>Carnus hemapterus</em>. You can see what your training site might look like at the end of the basic and advanced course at <a title="Example Carnidae training site" href="http://carnidae.myspecies.info" >http://carnidae.myspecies.info</a>.</p>
