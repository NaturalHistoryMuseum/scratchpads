<li>When looking at a taxon page, try creating a new 'page' as you did in the first exercise by clicking the 'Add a page node' icon in the Content menu. Enter a different taxonomic name in the title or body field, for example "Meoneura" and click on the 'Autotag' button. The page will be automatically tagged with any terms the system finds in the text and they appear in the Classification autocomplete field. Delete any terms you don't want this page tagged with. </li>
<li>Click 'save' and you will go back to the original taxon page your were on. A widget will appear with the text you have created. </li>
</ul>
<p>To watch as the "<em>Carnus hemapterus</em>" species page fills with data keep this page open and open a new tab in your browser window to continue with the manual (on a PC right click on the logo and choose 'Open Link in New Tab'). When you have added new data you can switch back to the species page and refresh the window (Ctrl+F5)  to view the changes.</p>
