  <div class="content clear-block">
    <p>Autotagging means that when you save or import content, this content is automatically tagged with all the terms of the associated vocabularies that are present in the title or one of the other fields. If for example the title includes a binominal species name, the node is automatically tagged with this species name as well as the genus name, since the genus name is part of the species name.</p>
<p>Check out the 'Autotag settings' (.../admin/settings/autotag) on the advanced administration page for more options.</p>
<p>The default for all content types is on the autotagging. If you want to disable autotagging you can either do this on the 'Autotag settings' page, or you edit the respective content type and disable autotagging under the 'Autotag settings' section.<img src="/sites/scratchpads.eu/files/u3/Non-autotag.jpg" alt="non-autotagging view" title="non-autotagging view" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 2px 5px; float: left;" width="338" height="37" /> When you create or edit content of this type you will now have only one page, which contains a field where you can enter the terms you need (see non-autotagging view image). They will autocomplete as you type and the node number of the term will be visible behind the term. However, the node number will not be visible when you have saved and view your node.</p>
