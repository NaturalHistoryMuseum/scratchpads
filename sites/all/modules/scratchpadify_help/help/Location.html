    <p>Location data in a Scratchpad conform to the Darwin Core (version 1.2.1) format recommended by TDWG (Biodiversity Information Standards) and GBIF. Together with the specimen content type, the location content type is used to create specimen data. You can connect different specimens to the same locality.</p>
<p>It is important to create unique location titles because the title is used to link specimens to localities.</p>
<p>Extend the 'Extra fields' section to add your data into the standard fields as much as possible. Only data that do not fit into these fields should go into the 'Locality' field.</p>
<p>If you don't know the longitude and latitude of the location you can try to search gazetters like the <a title="NGA GEOnet Names Server" href="http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/" >NGA GEOnet Names Server (GNS</a>) or the <a title="Getty Thesaurus" href="http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/tgn/" >Getty Thesaurus</a>.
