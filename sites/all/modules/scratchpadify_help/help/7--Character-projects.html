    <h3>Build a character matrix </h3>
<p class="Notes">Our data matrix editor is a work in progress. It allows you to build a database of characters suitable for phylogenetic analysis, identification keys or tables of numeric or textural descriptions Currently you can export controlled characters into SDD format and DNA characters into NEXUS format. Subsequent work on the editor will support the import and export of data in various formats for phylogenetic analysis, key construction and character lists and datasets formatted for publication.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the 'Add a Character Project node' icon in the Content menu. Give your project a title and a brief description.</li>
<li>Under 'Vocabulary', choose the Carnidae classification and enter the terms you would like to include in your project. If you have many taxa it will be easier to select taxa at the next stage. Click 'Save'.</li>
<li>If you haven't selected your taxa already, click on the 'Select taxa' tab. You can select your taxa by checking them in the extendable classification tree. If you select a taxon while the tree is not extended, all child taxa of this taxon will be selected as well. If you select a taxon while its child taxa are extended, only the taxon itself will be selected.</li>
<li>Add some characters by clicking the 'Add Character' button on the right hand side of the matrix. Try a mix of restricted characters, numeric characters and text characters. Each character has to be added to a group. Try creating several groups.</li>
<li>Try 'Scoring' the characters in the data editor, just like you would if you were editing data in an Excel spreadsheet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click on the 'Organise characters' tab to change the order of your characters. Try dragging and dropping the characters within a group and between groups. <em>The latter currently does not save due to a bug (23.9.2010)</em></p>
