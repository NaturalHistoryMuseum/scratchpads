<li>Firstly, we will import a bibliography that has been exported from Endnote into XML format. </li>
<li>Download the "<a title="Biblio import file" href="path:Biblio_Import.xml" >Biblio_Import.xml</a>" file, which is in Endnote 8+ XML format. </li>
<li>Bibliographic references can be automatically tagged with taxon names held within a Scratchpad classification. This works through the title and keywords fields. Autotagging needs to be enabled by going to the advanced administration page and clicking on 'Autotag settings' in the 'Site configuration' section. Under 'Default for "Autotag on save"', select "Biblio" and save the configuration.</li>
<li>Click the 'Import a Bibliography from your reference manager' icon appearing next to 'Biblio' in the 'Content' menu. This will bring up a form with a number of options. Browse for the XML file you just downloaded; select Endnote 8 XML from the pull down menu; then click 'Import'. Wait while the records are imported. </li>
<li>Click 'Biblio' in the Content menu and you should see all your imported records. Switch to the <em>Carnus hemapterus</em> species page, refresh it and scroll down to the Bibliography panel to see the biblios tagged with this term. Switch back to the Biblio page.</li>
