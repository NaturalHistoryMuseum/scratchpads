    <p>We currently offer the option to export taxon descriptions, as well as images and biblios attached to the respective taxon, to EOL. </p>
<ul>
<li>To export data from your Scratchpad, you need to sign up as a content partner with EOL at <a href="http://www.eol.org/content/partners" title="http://www.eol.org/content/partners">http://www.eol.org/content/partners</a>.</li>
<li>Fill in all the necessary fields and under 'Manage resources' create a new resource description. </li>
<li>Enter a title and under 'Indicate below the full URL...' enter "XXX/spm/export.xml" (replace the "XXX" with the URL of your Scratchpad!). Fill in the other fields as you see fit. As 'default rights holder' you should enter your full name if you are the only user providing data. Otherwise leave empty. Click the 'Create resource' button.</li>
<li>Your resource will now show up on the 'Manage resources' page. For testing purposes you can click the 'Force' link, which ensures that EOL will harvest your data during the next night (sometimes it takes longer).</li>
<li>If you don't change the settings on your Scratchpad, EOL will harvest all taxon descriptions. If you want to export only selected descriptions, go to the advanced administration menu of your Scratchpad and click on 'Taxon page export' in the site configuration section. All species that have taxon descriptions will show up. Select the taxa that you want to export and click on the 'Save configuration' button.</li>
<li>As soon as EOL has harvested your data, the 'Status' on the 'Manage resources' page will change to "Processed". If you now search for your imported taxa (while being logged in) you can preview your taxon descriptions and images with a yellow background, which means that they have not been published, yet. The bibliographic references currently don't show as long as they are not published.</li>
<li>EOL will contact you if something is missing in your agreement, help you if you get stuck adding a resource, and work to make sure that the content previews well. They will contact you to tell you that your content is ready to preview (usually one or two days after the file is submitted to us). Once you are mutually agreed they will publish your data. EOL tries to work with each partner within 24 to 48 hours of them registering in the Content Partner registry.
<p>However, if you don't hear from them or have questions, you can always contact EOL at <a href="http://www.eol.org/contact_us" title="http://www.eol.org/contact_us">http://www.eol.org/contact_us</a> (choosing content partner support) or directly emailing <a href="mailto:affiliate@eol.org">affiliate@eol.org</a>.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the Scratchpads 2.0 upgrade we plan to improve the export and for example create an option to select which images to export to EOL or to export images and biblios for taxa that have no taxon description.</p>
