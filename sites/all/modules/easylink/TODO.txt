Intro
----
There are a few features that should be added to this module.  I don't have
time to do them right now, but I figured it would be good to give this module
to the community ASAP.  If you want to add functionality, please contact
techstaff@linuxbox.com to have it incorporated into the module package.

TODO
----
o Check into automating the process of installing the TinyMCE plugin.
o Allow window size to be configured or possibly automatic.
