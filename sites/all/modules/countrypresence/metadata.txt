Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Data is derived most from world admin dataset from ESRI (1998), with additions form districts/countries that have changes and the addition of islands from WVS 1:3,000,000. Scale of dataset would be 1:5,000,000 to 1:3,000,000
  Completeness_Report: This is the first release of this dataset. there is likely to be a few mistakes

The data are generalized and were designed for display at scales to about 1:10,000,000.  The data were generalized from ESRI's ArcWorld Supplement Map data.

          Other_Citation_Details:
            The World Data Bank II outline files are digitized from navigational charts to a
            working scale of approximately 1:3 Million, and represent the "state of the art"
            in the mid 1970s. There are three files composing the WDB-II set on this CD-ROM:
            coastlines, rivers and lakes, and political boundaries (the last becoming
            increasingly obsolete!). Some of the details contained in the original WDB files,
            such as "order" of the elements (as related to size and importance of islands or
            lakes) have been left out of these versions -- the full and official WDB is
            available from the National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Level 4 table, odbc to Arcview 3.2 and joined first on country name in admin 98, if hit the level 4 code was added to the admin98.dbf, then joined on administration boundary name. Missed regions were added to the dbf file.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Some boundary, split by adding boundary line accross major polygon. Two resultant polygons reclassifed.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Addition polygons added from WVS 1:3 Million (from lines to polygons) from missed islands.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Tables from ArcView (dbf) imported into MSacess and compare to tables from the new standard. Any anomalise where corrected (master.shp)
    Process_Step:
