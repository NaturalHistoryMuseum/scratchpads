paranoia.module is for all the good sysadmins out there who think
that allowing random CMS admins to execute PHP of their choice is not
a safe idea.

What it will do is the following:

- Disable granting of the "use PHP for block visibility" permission.
  Save the permissions form once to remove all previous grants.
- Disable creation of input formats that use the PHP filter.
- Disable editing the user #1 account.
- Disable disabling this module. Yes, that's right you need to go 
  to the database to get rid of it again. It is also not shown as being installed.

To take full advantage of this module you need to delete the standard
PHP filter at admin/filters.
