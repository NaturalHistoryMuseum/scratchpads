Installation
------------

1) First you might disable the Drupal standard search.module
   Although search.module and trip_search.module work concurrently 
   together, it might be confusing for your users.
2) Create a new directory "trip_search" in the modules directory and 
   copy the module as well as popupcalendar, including all its contents,
   to the new directory.
3) Enable trip_search.module; if you already have a lot of nodes/comments
   this may take some time as the fulltext indexes are created.
4) Configure trip_search settings
5) Optionally enable the "Search" block
6) Optionally enable highlight.module from Contrib. It highlights words on 
   a node's page.
