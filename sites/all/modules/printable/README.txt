Description
------------

Printable provides a printable page link for all pages on a Drupal site. The 
pritable version can be themed through theme_printable_page().

While the base code is fairly complete, little layout/presentation work has
been done in this early draft.

This version is designed to prototype the approach, partly to see if this is
a useful approach to apply to the existing print.module or if a separate 
module is appropriate.
