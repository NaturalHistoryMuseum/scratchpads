<p>The TCS import service is provided for programmers and users who would like
to import a classification from a service that is capable of providing TCS.
We currently only know of one provider: <a href="http://software.speciesfile.org/HomePage.aspx" target="_blank">Species File</a>.
If you would like to import a classification from there, then please contact us.</p>
