<p>The Scratchpads have implemented a highly flexible system for storing a
biological classification. This means that the file formats listed below can
actually be extended or adjusted to suit your particular needs.  All file 
formats should include column headers.  The column headers should be named based
on the name of the fields into which you would like the data saving.  All 
taxonomies have the following basic fields:<ul><li><strong>name</strong> - The
term name.</li><li><strong>parent</strong> - The term name of this name's
parent.</li><li><strong>description</strong> - A short description of the term.
This field should not be used for species descriptions, but should instead be
considered as a notes field.</li><li><strong>synonyms</strong> - Alternative
names for a term.  Note, these should <strong>NOT</strong> be used for
biological classification synonyms - we have a much more sophisticated method of
storing these.</li></ul>
