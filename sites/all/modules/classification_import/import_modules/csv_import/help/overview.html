<p>The CSV file import supports importing data that you have already created
using a tool like Excel or Openoffice.  We currently support two different
<a href="&topic:csv_import/filetypes&">file formats</a>.  This import mechanism
is only intended for those users who work on a group not well covered by the
Catalogue of Life and other import sources, or for those users who are advanced
taxonomists, working at the very cutting edge of taxonomy.</p><p>Files should
be created as either comma-delimited or tab-delimitted files.  Cells may include
quotes around the text within them (this is necessary if using the
comma-delimited format, and a cell contains a comma).  Most of the time the
default settings of your Excel or Openoffice should suffice.</p><p>Once a file
has been created, you may test the import on the
<a href="http://sandbox.scratchpads.eu" target="_blank">Scratchpad sandbox</a>
first, or simply go ahead and import it into your site.</p>
