<p>The CSV/Tab delimited file import supports importing data that you have already created
using a tool like Excel or Openoffice.  We currently support two different
<a href="&topic:csv_import/filetypes&">file formats</a>.  This import mechanism
is only intended for those users who work on a group not well covered by the
Catalogue of Life and other import sources, or for those users who are advanced
taxonomists, working at the very cutting edge of taxonomy.</p><p>Files should
be created as either comma-delimited or tab-delimited files.  Cells may include
quotes around the text within them (this is necessary if using the
comma-delimited format, and a cell contains a comma).</p><p>Text needs to be 
encoded as UTF-8, which is not possible by using Excel. So if you have created 
a comma- or tab-delimited using Excel you need to open this file in Word, save 
it as 'Plain text (*.txt)', which opens a dialog box in which you can select 
'other encoding' and choose 'Unicode (UTF-8)'.</p><p>Once a file
has been created, you may test the import on the

first, or simply go ahead and import it into your site.</p>
