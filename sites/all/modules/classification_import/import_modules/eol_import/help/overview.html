<p>Importing a classification from the EOL classification service is a quick and
easy way of getting started with your site.  The classifications provided by this
service should not be considered to be the definitive classification for a group,
but they should help to get you started in creating the definitive classification
on your Scratchpad.</p><p>The service currently supports a number of classifications
from different data sources, including:<ul style="line-height:100%">
<li><a href="http://www.catalogueoflife.org/" target="_blank">Catalogue of Life</a></li>
<li><a href="http://starcentral.mbl.edu/" target="_blank">CU*Star</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.itis.gov/" target="_blank">ITIS</a></li></ul>
<p><strong>Please note, this service is VERY SLOW.  Please be patient when doing
an import.</strong></p>
<p>If you use this service you need to <strong>cite the data provider</strong> on your Scratchpad. 
See the <a href="http://scratchpads.eu/eol-import-data-providers-should-be-credited" target="_blank">
Scratchpad blog</a> for information on how to cite.</p>
