Aegir -- Mac OS X installation instructions hints
=================================================

This is a helper file to the canonical INSTALL.txt. It is aimed at
helping you install Aegir on Mac OS X. It simply lists commands that
diverge from the base INSTALL.txt in a concise document that will be
easy to maintain in the long term.

It is recommended that the INSTALL.txt document is consulted before
going ahead with this install.

We reuse the same process describe in that document:

 1. Install requirements
 2. Configure system requirements, which include:
    * create a Aegir user
    * configure Apache, MySQL, DNS, etc
 3. Run the install script

1. Install software requirements
================================

While Mac OS X comes with Apache & PHP (and even MySQL on the Server
version), the version of PHP shipped with 10.6 Snow Leopard is 5.3.x
and thus may not work with Aegir (as of the 0.4alpha-era) and various
other software. If you're running 10.5 Leopard, it may work out of the
box, but I haven't tested it.

There are several different ways to get Apache, PHP 5.2, and MySQL 5
onto a Mac OS X machine. I give detailed instructions for MacPorts
below, but if that's a bit more than you're ready to bite off right
now, feel free to use an alternative approach.

One such alternative is MAMP. There is a good but outdated HOWTO for
installing Aegir on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) using MAMP located
here: http://groups.drupal.org/node/30270

MAMP stands for Mac, Apache, MySQL, and PHP and is the Mac equivalent
of "LAMP". It is a self-contained package of all of these programs
with a nice graphical installer and control panel.  You can find it
here: http://www.mamp.info/

MAMP is pretty straightforward, but it's also not very flexible
(IMHO).  While certainly not without its own headaches, MacPorts is a
decently powerful way to sanely manage a healthy stack of open source
UNIX software on your Mac. Since this is what I use, I'm going to
assume MacPorts is in use for the rest of this HINTS file. I have also
only tested this on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.

If you don't yet have MacPorts installed, go here to get it:
http://www.macports.org/install.php

Once it's installed, quit and re-launch your Terminal before
continuing.  Otherwise MacPorts won't yet be in your PATH.

The first two commands below are optional but recommended.

Shell commands::
 sudo port selfupdate
 sudo port upgrade outdated
 sudo port install apache2 mysql5-server git-core unzip php52 +mysql5

Watch the output of the last port command carefully, as there are
usually some boring tasks for you to perform once the install is
done. You'll be wishing you were running Ubuntu/Debian and apt-get by
the time you're done.

2. Configure system requirements
================================

Next we'll create the aegir user and add it to the _www group. This
part is very different on Mac OS X than Linux or most other
Unices. Must be a NeXTism. The command we will use he is "dscl", which
is a short for Directory Service Command Line. In OSX 10.3 and
earlier, that command is "nicl" (short for Net Info Command Line).

Shell commands::
 sudo dscl . -create /Users/aegir NFSHomeDirectory /var/aegir

Now you need to find the next spare UID to assign the user.

Here's how you find out on your system:

Shell commands::
 sudo dsexport users.out /Local/Default dsRecTypeStandard:Users

Then open the file users.out in a text editor, search for the highest
5xx user ID and add 1 to it (in your brain, not in the file). So if
you find 506 but no 507, use 507. When you're done, delete users.out
to be safe.

Shell commands::
 sudo rm users.out

Now assign this UID to the aegir user, replacing "5xx" with the UID.

Shell commands::
 sudo dscl . -create /Users/aegir UniqueID 5xx

Set a secure password for the aegir user, as it needs shell access.

Shell Commands::
 sudo passwd aegir

Create the aegir home directory and set its permissions.

Shell Commands::
 sudo mkdir /var/aegir
 sudo chown aegir /var/aegir
 sudo chgrp _www /var/aegir

Add the aegir user to the _www group. This is the group Apache runs as.

Shell Commands::
 sudo dscl . -append /Groups/_www GroupMembership aegir

Give the aegir user the ability to restart Apache.

Shell Commands::
 sudo mv /usr/sbin/apachectl /usr/sbin/apachectl-apple
 sudo ln -s /opt/local/apache2/bin/apachectl /usr/sbin/apachectl
 sudo visudo

Go to the last line of the file and add the following.

Sudoers file content::
 aegir ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/apachectl

Save the file and exit your text editor.

Next configure Apache to include the Aegir config.

Shell Commands::
 echo "Include /var/aegir/config/apache.conf" >> /opt/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf
 /opt/local/apache2/bin/apachectl restart

Configuring your MySQL database and user accounts is the same as in
the INSTALL.txt file. But you probably want to add the path to its
executables to your user's PATH and the aegir user's PATH.

Shell Commands::

 echo 'export PATH=/opt/local/lib/mysql5/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile
 su - aegir
 Password: (the password you setup earlier)
 echo 'export PATH=/opt/local/lib/mysql5/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile
 exit

3. Run the install script
=========================

Now follow the instructions of section 3 of INSTALL.txt, except for
when it tells you to run "su -s /bin/sh aegir -c "sh install.sh.txt 
aegir.example.com" do the following instead.

Shell commands::
 su - aegir
 Password: (you know the drill)
 sh /path/to/install.sh.txt aegir.example.com
 sudo /usr/sbin/apachectl restart
 exit

Be sure to change 'aegir.example.com' to match the URI of your site.

You can append '--client_email=you@example.com' if you wish to receive the
traditional Drupal 'Welcome' e-mail upon completion of the installation.
This e-mail address will also be used as the default e-mail address of the
first user and client in Aegir, but can be changed later.
